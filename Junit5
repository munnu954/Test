To achieve complete coverage of the conditional statement in your method, let's clarify the logical branches in the condition:

```java
if(StringUtils.isBlank(cnd) || ((!StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y")))) {
    cnd = "N";
} else {
    cnd = "Y";
}
```

### Breakdown of Conditions

1. **`StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)`**: This checks if `cnd` is `null`, empty, or contains only whitespace.
2. **`(!StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y"))`**: This checks if `cnd` is not blank and is also not "Y".

### Possible Branch Scenarios

1. **`cnd` is blank**: The condition `StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)` is true, so `cnd` becomes "N".
2. **`cnd` is not blank and not "Y"**: The second part of the OR condition is true, so `cnd` is set to "N".
3. **`cnd` is "Y"**: Both parts of the OR condition are false, so the else branch is executed, setting `cnd` to "Y".

### Tests for All Scenarios

1. **Test with `cnd` as `null`** (already covered)
2. **Test with `cnd` as empty string** (already covered)
3. **Test with `cnd` as whitespace** (already covered)
4. **Test with `cnd` as "Y"** (already covered)
5. **Test with `cnd` as "N"** (already covered)
6. **Test with `cnd` as any other non-Y string** (this is likely the missing part)

Given this understanding, if the branch for a non-blank string that is neither "Y" nor any other specific value has not been covered explicitly, let's add a test for a case where `cnd` is a non-blank, non-"Y" value that hasn't been tested yet:

```java
@Test
public void testGetClrGraphicsWithOtherString() throws Exception {
    String circuitId = "testCircuitId";
    String sourceSys = "testSourceSys";
    String cnd = "Z"; // Non-blank and not "Y"
    String phyModel = "testPhyModel";
    String expectedResponse = "expectedResponse";

    when(service.getClrGraphics(anyString(), anyString(), anyString(), anyString())).thenReturn(expectedResponse);

    String response = controller.getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, cnd, phyModel);

    Assertions.assertNotNull(response);
    Assertions.assertEquals(expectedResponse, response);
    verify(service, times(1)).getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, "N", phyModel); // Ensure "N" is passed to the method
}
```

This test case ensures that when `cnd` is any non-blank string that isn't "Y", it is set to "N". This should cover the last possible branch in your conditional logic. If you continue to encounter issues with branch coverage, it may be helpful to re-examine how the coverage tool interprets the condition or consider if any external factors might influence the test execution.
