To cover the remaining branch of the `isValidData` method, we need to consider a test case that ensures each condition inside the `else if` statement is tested individually. Since the conditions are combined with logical OR (`||`), ensuring each individual condition is covered requires specific inputs.

The existing tests cover:
- `input.isBlank()`
- `input.isEmpty()`
- `input.equals("0")`

However, the combination of `isEmpty()` and `isBlank()` might not be fully covered separately. Since `isBlank()` already covers `isEmpty()`, let's focus on ensuring that we have a test case for a non-blank, non-empty input that isn't "0" to ensure complete coverage.

Here is an additional test case that ensures the input is neither blank nor empty, and isn't "0":

```java
@Test
public void testIsValidData_WhitespaceOnly() {
    assertFalse(batchLoaderUtils.isValidData("\t\n"));  // Tests whitespace input
}
```

### Explanation

- **Whitespace Input**: This test, `testIsValidData_WhitespaceOnly`, ensures that an input consisting of only whitespace characters (like tabs or newlines) is correctly evaluated by the `isBlank()` condition separate from `isEmpty()`. This covers any potential gaps in logical branching where whitespace inputs are considered.
