To achieve full branch coverage for the conditional statement in the `getClrGraphics` method, let's analyze the condition again:

```java
if(StringUtils.isBlank(cnd) || ((!StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y")))) {
    cnd = "N";
} else {
    cnd = "Y";
}
```

The condition `StringUtils.isBlank(cnd) || ((!StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y")))` can be broken down into:

1. `StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)`: This checks if `cnd` is `null`, empty, or contains only whitespace.
2. `(!StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y"))`: This checks if `cnd` is not blank and not equal to "Y".

The branches to be covered include:

- `cnd` is blank (covers `StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)`).
- `cnd` is not blank and not "Y" (covers `(!StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y"))`).
- `cnd` is "Y" (covers the `else` branch).

From your description, it seems that one branch is not covered. Considering the breakdown, the most likely missing branch is when `cnd` is a valid non-blank string, but it is not "Y". This branch seems to be covered by the provided test cases, but let's make sure by adding a test case to explicitly ensure this condition is covered correctly.

Here's the test case that should ensure the missing branch is covered:

```java
@Test
public void testGetClrGraphicsWithNonYNonBlankCnd() throws Exception {
    String circuitId = "testCircuitId";
    String sourceSys = "testSourceSys";
    String cnd = "N"; // Non-blank and not "Y"
    String phyModel = "testPhyModel";
    String expectedResponse = "expectedResponse";

    when(service.getClrGraphics(anyString(), anyString(), anyString(), anyString())).thenReturn(expectedResponse);

    String response = controller.getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, cnd, phyModel);

    Assertions.assertNotNull(response);
    Assertions.assertEquals(expectedResponse, response);
    verify(service, times(1)).getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, "N", phyModel); // Ensure "N" is passed to the method
}
```

This test case ensures that when `cnd` is a non-blank value other than "Y", it is set to "N" before calling the service method. This should cover the missing branch in your conditional logic. If you still find a branch not covered, ensure the test setup and conditions align with what the logic is actually evaluating.
