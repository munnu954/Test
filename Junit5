ChatbotAI here. I apologize for the error in the previous code. Here's an updated version of the `testApplyPostingRulesWithHigherPriorityRule` test case that should work without any issues:

```java
@Test
void testApplyPostingRulesWithHigherPriorityRule() {
    // Arrange
    Map<String, PostingRule> ruleMap = new HashMap<>();
    ruleMap.put("rule1", rule1);
    ruleMap.put("rule2", rule2);
    when(ruleLoadingService.getRuleMap()).thenReturn(ruleMap);
    when(rule1.matchFilter(alarmMap)).thenReturn(true);
    when(rule2.matchFilter(alarmMap)).thenReturn(true);
    when(rule1.getRulePriority()).thenReturn(1);
    when(rule2.getRulePriority()).thenReturn(2);

    // Act
    Alarm result = service.applyPostingRules(alarm);

    // Assert
    verify(service).applyPostingRule(alarm, rule2, alarmMap);
}
```

Here's the explanation of the changes made:

1. Instead of using an anonymous inner class to create the `HashMap`, we're creating a new `HashMap` instance and populating it with the test rules.
2. We're using the `when(ruleLoadingService.getRuleMap()).thenReturn(ruleMap);` to set the expected return value of the `getRuleMap()` method.
3. The rest of the test case remains the same, verifying that the `applyPostingRule()` method is called with the rule with the higher priority.

The issue with the previous code was that the anonymous inner class is not serializable, which caused the error related to the `serialVersionUID` field. By using a regular `HashMap` instance, we avoid this issue.

Please note that the other test cases in the previous example should also work with this update.
