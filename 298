Apologies for the oversight. To achieve 100% code coverage for the `fetchTopologyTraversalDetails` method, we need to cover all possible execution paths, including the scenario where an exception occurs without a 404 status code.

Here's an additional test case to cover that scenario:

```java
@Test
public void testFetchTopologyTraversalDetails_ExceptionWithout404Status() throws Exception {
    Alarm alarm = new Alarm();
    PostingRule rule = new PostingRule();
    String componentIdReq = "123";

    when(restTemplate.exchange(eq(TOPOLOGYTRAVERSAL_URL), eq(HttpMethod.POST), any(HttpEntity.class),
            eq(String.class))).thenThrow(new RestClientException("500 Internal Server Error"));

    ResponseEntity<String> response = topologyApiClient.fetchTopologyTraversalDetails(alarm, rule, componentIdReq);

    assertNull(response);
    verify(restTemplate, times(1)).exchange(eq(TOPOLOGYTRAVERSAL_URL), eq(HttpMethod.POST), any(HttpEntity.class),
            eq(String.class));
}
```

This test case covers the scenario where an exception is thrown with a status code other than 404 (in this case, 500 Internal Server Error).

Now, with the addition of this test case, all possible execution paths of the `fetchTopologyTraversalDetails` method are covered, resulting in 100% code coverage.
