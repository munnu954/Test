But some errors were reported in PLE on May 19th. Is there a possibility of deleting recorded logs on Elastic? As you can see in the screenshot, error messages were recorded for AlarmPosting on May 19th. When I search for the same error again on today's date, Elastic search results don't display any error records for the AlarmPosting service on PLE and PROD. I also checked with Kumar.

Apologies, but I'll be traveling from the office during DSU time, so network connectivity will be poor and a lot of background disturbances will occur.

Can you please approve this Adom request I raised 3 days ago. I'm unable to build or run microservices locally, so please grant me access to vi1v_art artifactory.

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.
