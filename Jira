Positive Scenarios:
1. Test that the CollectorInitializer successfully retrieves Space_Collector json from the kafka topic 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE.
2. Test that the CollectorInitializer successfully initializes the CollectorApiReader with the Space_Collector json retrieved from the kafka topic.

Negative Scenarios:
1. Test that the CollectorInitializer fails to retrieve Space_Collector json from the kafka topic 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE when there is no data in the queue.
2. Test that the CollectorInitializer fails to initialize the CollectorApiReader with the Space_Collector json retrieved from the kafka topic when the json data is invalid or incomplete.
3. Test that the Space_Collector json fails validation when it does not have a valid ID field or it is null.
4. Test that the Space_Collector json fails validation when it does not have a valid IP address in the URL field or it is null.
5. Test that the Space_Collector json fails validation when it does not have a valid port number or it is null.
6. Test that the Space_Collector json fails validation when it does not have a valid connection_type which is API or it is null.
