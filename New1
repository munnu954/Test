To achieve 100% code coverage for the given `HealthController` class, you can use JUnit and Mockito to write a test case. Here's a complete and executable JUnit test case for the `HealthController` class:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

@SpringBootTest
public class HealthControllerTest {

    @MockBean
    private HealthController healthController;

    @Test
    public void testHealthCheck() {
        // Mock the behavior of the healthCheck method
        Mockito.when(healthController.healthCheck()).thenReturn("Application is up and running!");

        // Call the healthCheck method
        String result = healthController.healthCheck();

        // Verify the result
        assertEquals("Application is up and running!", result);
    }
}
```

In this test case:
- `@InjectMocks` and `@MockBean` annotations are used to inject the `HealthController` instance and mock the dependencies respectively.
- The `testHealthCheck` method tests the `healthCheck` method of the `HealthController`. It first mocks the behavior of the method to return a specific message and then calls the method to validate the result.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies like JUnit and Mockito in your project to run this test case successfully. Additionally, you can add more test cases to cover edge cases or handle exceptions if required to improve the test coverage further.
