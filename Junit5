Certainly! Here's the query framed in a single line:

```sql
SELECT switch.switch_name AS tid, site.clli_code AS clli, site.site_name FROM gdnm_switch switch LEFT JOIN gdnm_hardware hardware ON switch.hardware_id = hardware.id LEFT JOIN gdnm_site site ON switch.site_id = site.id WHERE switch.switch_name = LOWER(:tid) OR switch.switch_name = UPPER(:tid);
```
