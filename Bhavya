I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems that the error is related to the mismatch between the argument type expected by the setKeyPairProvider method and the argument provided in the code. To resolve this, you can try the following approach:

```java
// Create an instance of SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider
SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider keyProvider = new SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider();

// Cast the keyProvider object to the expected type
Object keyProviderObject = (Object) keyProvider;

// Call the setKeyPairProvider method with the type-casted argument
sshServer.setKeyPairProvider((<org.apache.sshd.server.keyprovider.SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider>) keyProviderObject);
```

In the above code snippet, we first create an instance of SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider and then cast it to the expected type before passing it as an argument to the setKeyPairProvider method. This should help resolve the error related to the type mismatch in the argument of the setKeyPairProvider method.

Please give this code snippet a try and let me know if it resolves the error. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for more assistance.
