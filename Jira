My colleague's device is dead, and he has lost his access to the DUO mobile application. He'll be sending a one-time password to your email. Can you please share the OTP with me so that I can relay it to him and help him regain access to his DUO mobile application?

Can you please approve this Adom request I raised 3 days ago. I'm unable to build or run microservices locally, so please grant me access to vi1v_art artifactory.

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.
