@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.myapp", "com.external.jar"})



Initially, the Express OCP deployment was failing due to the 'SSL Handshake failed' error. In order to fix this error, I updated the ApolloKafkaLibrary service to include newer Kafka certificate files that were provided by the VMB team. I added Kafka properties in the Helm properties, added missing config maps to the OCP-ExpressDeployment, fixed the Redisson certificate path error, and fixed a NullPointerException in parser classes. After fixing these errors, the GeneratedAlarmNormalizer and SamsungUSMNormalizer are up and running on OCP DEV.
