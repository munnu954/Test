Can you please approve my CANVAS access request that I submitted last week during your free time. I will need this access to work on my new assignment with UTS Topology team. Thank you very much.

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.

update the above finalQuery such that the finalQuery should checks if the locationCLLI and siteName parameters are present in the queryParams map. If they are present, it appends the corresponding conditions to the finalQuery. If they are not present, it does not append anything to the finalQuery. The resulting finalQuery will work even without locationCLLI or siteName.




I'm a new member who recently joined UTS Topology from Verizon's SPACE program, can you please approve my Git access request which I submitted today, thank you.
