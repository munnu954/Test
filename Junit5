Dear Delivery Manager,

As you are aware, the Holy month of Ramadan will be observed from 18 February 2026 to 20 March 2026. During this period, I will be available between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM. After 6:00 PM, I will not be available as I need to break my fast and offer necessary prayers until 11:00 PM. 

To ensure continuity of work, I will log in again at 9:00 PM and continue until 6:00 PM during this month. I kindly request your approval for this adjusted schedule.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Shaik Maqbool Ahmed
