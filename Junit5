@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.myapp", "com.external.jar"})

The AlarmNormalizer's image is the same for all the normalizer instances. We are testing the generatedAlarmNormalizer and samsungusmAlarmNormalizer instances. For the generatedAlarmNormalizer, there is a certificate path error; it may be due to the Reddison. Hemant asked me to check with Kumar regarding this certificate path error. We also tried testing the samsungusmAlarmNormalizer instance, but there were some different errors. I was expecting the same certificate path error as that of the generatedAlarmNormalizer since all the normalizer instances were built on the same image. However, different NullPointerException errors were recorded for the samsungusmAlarmNormalizer instance. I'll check with Chintu later today regarding the errors of the samsungusmAlarmNormalizer instance.
