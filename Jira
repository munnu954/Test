It would be very difficult for me to log in from the hostel with a mobile hotspot. My availability will be limited to office hours on the days when I work from the office.

I updated the generated alarm normalizer parser code as per Dmitry's email, raised an MR, and Dmitry approved my MR. He also reviewed my test evidence document; hopefully, he accepts the Jira now.

Apologies, but I'll be traveling from the office during DSU time, so network connectivity will be poor and a lot of background disturbances will occur.

Can you please approve this Adom request I raised 3 days ago. I'm unable to build or run microservices locally, so please grant me access to vi1v_art artifactory.

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.
