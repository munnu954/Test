The `UnnecessaryStubbingException` you're encountering in Mockito typically occurs when you've defined a stub for a method that is never actually called during the test execution. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the stubs we create are necessary for the execution of the test.

In your scenario, it seems that the stubbing for `jobExecution.getStartTime()` and `jobExecution.getEndTime()` might not be required depending on how the `scheduleBatchJob` method is implemented. If it leads to those methods not being called due to an early return or other control flow, Mockito will flag them as unnecessary stubbings.

To fix this, we can simplify the test case and ensure that only the necessary stubs are created. Hereâ€™s a modified version of your test case:

### Modified Test Case

```java
@Test
public void testScheduleBatchJob_WhenJobExecutionTimesAreNull_ShouldThrowException() throws Exception {
    // Arrange
    when(kafkaFalloutService.hasRecords()).thenReturn(true);
    when(jobLauncher.run(any(Job.class), any(JobParameters.class))).thenReturn(jobExecution);
    
    // Stubbing to return null for start and end time
    when(jobExecution.getStartTime()).thenReturn(null);
    when(jobExecution.getEndTime()).thenReturn(null);

    // Act & Assert
    IllegalArgumentException exception = assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        kafkaFalloutScheduler.scheduleBatchJob();
    });
    assertEquals("Job Execution Start or End time is null", exception.getMessage());
}
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Necessary Stubbing**: Ensure that the stubbing for `jobExecution.getStartTime()` and `jobExecution.getEndTime()` is indeed necessary. In this case, they are necessary because they are directly related to the exception being tested.
  
- **Mockito's Behavior**: If there are still unnecessary stubbings detected, double-check the implementation of the `scheduleBatchJob` method to confirm that it actually invokes `getStartTime()` and `getEndTime()`.

- **Mockito Annotations**: Ensure that you're using the `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` annotation to enable Mockito in your test class.

If you continue to run into issues, it may be helpful to clear any unused stubs from prior test cases or refactor the tests to ensure that each test case is self-contained and does not retain unused stubs from previous tests.
