Certainly! The error indicates that the `evaluateExpression` method did not throw an exception when an invalid expression was passed. To fix this, we need to ensure that `evaluateExpression` indeed throws an exception for invalid expressions.

Here is the revised JUnit 5 test case:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;

import java.util.HashMap;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class AlarmPostingUtilsTest {

    @Test
    void evaluateExpression_withInvalidExpression() {
        // Arrange
        String expression = "%invalidExpression%";
        AlarmPostingUtils alarmPostingUtils = new AlarmPostingUtils();

        // Act and Assert
        assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> {
            alarmPostingUtils.evaluateExpression(expression, new HashMap<>());
        });
    }
}
```

Ensure that you have the necessary imports and that the `AlarmPostingUtils` class and its `evaluateExpression` method are correctly defined. If the `evaluateExpression` method is not throwing an exception for invalid expressions, you might need to modify its implementation to handle such cases appropriately.
