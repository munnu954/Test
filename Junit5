To prevent the "java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.sql.Connection.createStatement()" because "conn" is null" error in the `testHealthWithNullConnection` test case, you can modify the code as follows:

```java
@Test
void testHealthWithNullConnection() throws SQLException {
    when(ds.getConnection()).thenReturn(null); // Mocking getConnection() to return null
    ReflectionTestUtils.setField(databaseHealthContributor, "ds", ds);
    
    Health health = databaseHealthContributor.health();
    assertEquals(Status.DOWN, health.getStatus()); // Assuming status will be DOWN if connection is null
    
    Mockito.verifyZeroInteractions(Mockito.any());
}
```

By adding the `Mockito.verifyZeroInteractions(Mockito.any())` line at the end of the test case, you are verifying that there are no interactions with any mocks. This will help prevent the `NullPointerException` when trying to invoke methods on a `null` object.

Ensure that you have the necessary Mockito dependencies and imports in your test class for this solution to work correctly.
