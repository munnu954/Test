I'm working on release preparation and BAU monitoring for this iteration. Do you have any code, rules, database, or Helm changes for the production release?

Dmitry wants Aggregation and Grouping rules to be deployed only in the PLE environment, not in the PROD environment. Can I add a note in the release content?
