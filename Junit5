The `NoSuchMethodError` you're encountering typically indicates that the classpath contains an incompatible version of a library that doesn't have the expected method. In this case, the method `new JSONObject(Object)` isn't found, which means the version of the `json` library you are using does not support creating a `JSONObject` directly from an object. 

To fix this error, you need to ensure that the version of the `org.json` library you are using indeed supports this constructor, or you need to manually convert the object to a `Map` or `String` that can be used to create a `JSONObject`.
