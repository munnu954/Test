Test scenario 4:
- Input: A sample CSV file with invalid data (e.g., incorrect data types, missing values)
- Action: Read the sample CSV file
- Expected Output: The CSV data is read successfully, but contains invalid or missing data
- Action: Invoke the CsvToJson Transformer class to convert the CSV data to JSON
- Expected Output: The CsvToJson class handles the invalid data and provides appropriate error messages or warnings in the JSON output
- Action: Validate the error messages and warnings in the JSON output

Test scenario 5:
- Input: A sample CSV file with special characters or escape sequences
- Action: Read the sample CSV file
- Expected Output: The CSV data is read successfully, including special characters or escape sequences
- Action: Invoke the CsvToJson Transformer class to convert the CSV data to JSON
- Expected Output: The CsvToJson class correctly handles special characters and escape sequences, ensuring that they are properly handled in the JSON output
- Action: Validate the special characters and escape sequences in the JSON output

These additional test scenarios cover the negative test cases for CSV to JSON conversion, ensuring that the CsvToJson Transformer class appropriately handles invalid or special data in the CSV input.
