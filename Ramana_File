Sure, here are some positive and negative test cases for the Apache SSH Service:

## Positive test cases

1. Test that the SSH server can be started and stopped.
2. Test that the SSH server can accept connections from clients.
3. Test that the SSH server can authenticate users.
4. Test that the SSH server can execute commands on behalf of users.
5. Test that the SSH server can transfer files between clients and servers.

## Negative test cases

1. Test that the SSH server cannot be started if it is already running.
2. Test that the SSH server cannot accept connections if it is not configured to do so.
3. Test that the SSH server cannot authenticate users if the user database is not configured correctly.
4. Test that the SSH server cannot execute commands on behalf of users if the user permissions are not configured correctly.
5. Test that the SSH server cannot transfer files between clients and servers if the file transfer protocol is not configured correctly.

I hope this helps
