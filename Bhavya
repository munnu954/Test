The error message you're encountering indicates that the `kafkaTemplate.send()` method is not being invoked during the execution of your test case `testOnMessage_ValidPayload`. This suggests that the flow in the `onMessage` method might not be reaching the point where the message is sent to Kafka. 

### Analyzing the onMessage Method

Here are some common issues that could prevent `kafkaTemplate.send()` from being called:

1. **Payload Processing**: If the payload is invalid or if exceptions are thrown while processing the payload, the code may skip the sending logic.
2. **Conditional Logic**: If any conditions in the `onMessage` method cause early returns, the sending logic will not be executed.
3. **Mocking Behavior**: Ensure that all necessary mock setups are in place, particularly for methods that might throw exceptions or alter the flow.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Review the `onMessage` Method**: Make sure that the flow of execution in the `onMessage` method reaches the point where `kafkaTemplate.send()` is called. Add logging statements to help trace the execution flow.

2. **Ensure Valid Payload**: Make sure that `validPayload` is a properly formatted JSON string that can be successfully converted to a `ServiceMessage`.

3. **Mock the Right Calls**: Ensure all necessary methods that are called before `kafkaTemplate.send()` are mocked correctly so that they do not throw exceptions.

### Updated Test Method

Here's how you can structure your `testOnMessage_ValidPayload` method, ensuring that all necessary elements are in place:

```java
@Test
public void testOnMessage_ValidPayload() throws JsonProcessingException {
    // Create a valid payload for testing
    String validPayload = "{\"RequestJSONString\":\"{...}\",\"pxObjClass\":\"SomeClass\",\"pxUpdateDateTime\":\"2023-10-10T10:10:10\"}";

    // Set up a mock ServiceMessage and RequestJSONString
    ServiceMessage serviceMessage = new ServiceMessage();
    RequestJSONString requestJSONString = new RequestJSONString();
    Service service = new Service();
    ServiceBody serviceBody = new ServiceBody();
    CallRequest callRequest = new CallRequest();
    Body body = new Body();
    
    // Set up the body to include valid relinquishing customer details
    CustomerDetails relinquishingCustomerDetails = new CustomerDetails();
    relinquishingCustomerDetails.setAccountNumber("12345678");
    body.setRelinquishingCustomerDetails(relinquishingCustomerDetails);
    callRequest.setBody(body);
    serviceBody.setCallRequest(callRequest);
    service.setServiceBody(serviceBody);
    requestJSONString.setService(service);
    serviceMessage.setRequestJSONString(requestJSONString.toString());

    // Mock the behavior of utils.convert to return the expected ServiceMessage
    when(utils.convert(validPayload, ServiceMessage.class)).thenReturn(serviceMessage);
    when(utils.convert(requestJSONString.toString(), RequestJSONString.class)).thenReturn(requestJSONString);
    
    // Mock the accountService to return a valid ECPD ID
    when(accountService.getEcpdByAcctId(anyString())).thenReturn(Mono.just("someEcpdId"));
    
    // Call the method with the valid payload
    eventsMessageListener.onMessage(mockConsumerRecord(validPayload), validPayload);

    // Verify that the KafkaTemplate's send method was called
    verify(kafkaTemplate, times(1)).send(any(ProducerRecord.class));
    // Verify that no failed records were saved
    verify(failedMessageService, never()).saveFailedRecords(anyString(), anyString(), anyString(), anyString(), anyChar());
}

// Helper method to create a mock ConsumerRecord
private ConsumerRecord<String, String> mockConsumerRecord(String payload) {
    return new ConsumerRecord<>("topic", 0, 0L, "key", payload);
}
```

### Key Changes and Explanations

1. **Valid Payload Structure**: The `validPayload` string is structured as a valid JSON that matches the expected format of `ServiceMessage`.

2. **Mocking Method Calls**: The `utils.convert` method is mocked to return the appropriate `ServiceMessage` and `RequestJSONString`. Ensure that the `getEcpdByAcctId` method on the `accountService` is also mocked to return a valid Mono.

3. **Logging**: Add logging statements in the `onMessage` method to trace execution flow, helping you determine where it might be failing.

4. **Properly Mock ConsumerRecord**: The `mockConsumerRecord` method creates a mock `ConsumerRecord` that simulates incoming Kafka messages.

### Conclusion

With these adjustments, your test case should successfully invoke `kafkaTemplate.send()` when the `onMessage` method processes a valid payload. If the issue persists, consider stepping through the `onMessage` method with a debugger to see where the flow might be interrupted.
