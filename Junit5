To achieve 100% branch coverage for the `if` statement in the `getClrGraphics` method, we need to ensure that all possible paths through the condition are tested. The condition in your code is:

```java
if (StringUtils.isBlank(cnd) || ((StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y")))) {
    cnd = "N";
} else {
    cnd = "Y";
}
```

Let's analyze each part of the condition:

1. `StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)`: This is true if `cnd` is `null`, empty, or contains only whitespace.
2. `(StringUtils.isBlank(cnd) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y")))`: This checks if `cnd` is blank and not equal to "Y", which is effectively covered by the first condition alone because if `cnd` is blank, it can't be equal to "Y".

### Missed Branch
The missed branch is likely the `else` branch where `cnd` is neither blank nor equal to "Y". To cover this, we need to provide a `cnd` value that is non-blank and equal to "Y".

Here is the additional test case to cover this branch:

```java
@Test
public void testGetClrGraphicsWithNonBlankCndAndEqualsY() throws Exception {
    String circuitId = "testCircuitId";
    String sourceSys = "testSourceSys";
    String cnd = "Y"; // Non-blank and equals "Y"
    String phyModel = "testPhyModel";
    String expectedResponse = "expectedResponse";

    // Mock the service call to return a specific response
    when(service.getClrGraphics(anyString(), anyString(), eq("Y"), anyString())).thenReturn(expectedResponse);

    // Call the method under test
    String response = controller.getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, cnd, phyModel);

    // Verify that the response is not null and matches the expected response
    Assertions.assertNotNull(response);
    Assertions.assertEquals(expectedResponse, response);

    // Verify that the service method was called with the expected cnd value "Y"
    verify(service).getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, "Y", phyModel);
}
```

### Explanation

- **Setup Test Inputs:** Here, `cnd` is set to "Y", which is non-blank and should directly go to the `else` branch of the condition, assigning "Y" to `cnd`.
- **Mocking Service Call:** The mock checks if `getClrGraphics` is called with `cnd` as "Y".
- **Assertions:** Assert the response is as expected and validate that the service call was made correctly.

This test case should cover the missed branch and ensure that `cnd` is handled correctly when it's explicitly "Y". By adding it, you should achieve 100% branch coverage for the specified condition.
