I have asked Kumar to provide Mantaray alarms PLE evidence for S2I providers' Jira. Kumar informed me that there is a huge backlog in Alarm Deduplication. The alarms that were processed from Normalizer will take a long time to be inserted into downstream core services and to the database. As soon as Kumar provides the evidence, I'll prepare the demo document and move the Jira to 'Ready for Demo'.
