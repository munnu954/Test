To configure H2-db in the application.yml file, you can add the following configuration:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password: 
  h2:
    console:
      enabled: true
```

This configuration sets up the H2 database with an in-memory database named "testdb" and enables the H2 console.

By default, the H2 console starts on port 8082. However, you can change the port by adding the following configuration to the application.yml file:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8082
```

In this example, the H2 console will start on port 8082 instead of the default port 8082.
