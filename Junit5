Certainly! To update the test case code and make it pass without throwing an exception, you can modify the test method as follows:

```java
@Test
public void testXmlToJsonConversionWithInvalidXml() {
    String testXml = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>" +
            "<measInfo>" +
            "<measValue>" +
            "<duration>PT900S1</duration>" +
            "<elementType>PCC100</elementType>" +
            "</measValue>" +
            "</mInfo>"; // Invalid XML content with missing closing tag

    TestCollector<String> collector = new TestCollector<>();
    
    xmlToJsonConverter.flatMap(testXml, collector);

    List<String> collectedRecords = collector.getCollected();
    Assert.assertEquals(0, collectedRecords.size());
}
```

In the updated code:
1. Remove the `try-catch` block and the `Assert.fail` statement since we expect the test to pass without throwing an exception.
2. After calling `xmlToJsonConverter.flatMap`, retrieve the collected records from the `TestCollector` and assert that the size of the collected records is 0 using `Assert.assertEquals`. This ensures that no records were collected, indicating that the invalid XML did not result in any data being processed.

With these changes, the test case should pass without throwing an exception and the assertion should succeed.
