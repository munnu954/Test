* For the AlarmPosting Jira, I raised an MR to Chintu. He asked me to verify which normalizer parser file and which other service are sending the invalid tag value, as we may need to handle that as well. Currently, I found that the RAN_ERICSSON parser file has that tagList issue; I'll confirm with Chintu tomorrow regarding this.

* As for the BAU monitoring part, OutOfMemoryError for generatedAlarmNormalizer service, I attached this to the Jira.
* AlarmDeduplication service fix is almost done, I'll finalize it with Chintu today and deploy the fix.



Apologies, but I'll be traveling from the office during DSU time, so network connectivity will be poor and a lot of background disturbances will occur.

Can you please approve this Adom request I raised 3 days ago. I'm unable to build or run microservices locally, so please grant me access to vi1v_art artifactory.

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.
