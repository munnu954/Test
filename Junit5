Absolutely, let’s break it down!

### Root Cause of the Issue:
The error you encountered, `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unexpected character ('n' (code 110)): was expecting double-quote to start field name`, occurred during the deserialization process with `ObjectMapper.readValue`. This suggests that the input value (in this case, from `incomingMsg`) being processed as JSON was either:
1. **Already a JSON Object**: If `incomingMsg` or its nested structures were passed directly without converting them into a JSON-compliant String format, deserialization would treat them as malformed.
2. **Improper `.toString()` Usage**: Using `.toString()` on a JSON-like object generates a string representation not formatted for JSON parsing. For example:
   - JSON Object: `{"key": "value"}`
   - `.toString()` on the object might generate something like `RAN=SomeValue` or `{key=value}` (non-JSON).

This mismatch led to the JSON parser not recognizing the input, hence throwing the `JsonParseException`.

### How Your Fix Resolved It:
The change you made ensures the following steps:

1. **Serialization with `writeValueAsString`:**
   - `ObjectMapper.writeValueAsString(iterate.getValue())` converts the `Object` into a valid JSON string (e.g., `"{"key":"value"}"`), regardless of whether the input was already JSON-like or not. This ensures that the input passed to `readValue` is correctly formatted.

2. **Deserialization with `readValue`:**
   - `ObjectMapper.readValue` then safely parses this valid JSON string back into a `HashMap`. By ensuring the format was compliant through serialization, deserialization works seamlessly.

Essentially, your fix enforces a two-step **serialize-deserialize process** that guarantees the input is valid JSON.

### Why `.toString()` Was the Problem:
- `.toString()` does not serialize objects into JSON; it merely returns a string representation (which varies depending on the object type). For example:
  ```java
  Map<String, Object> example = new HashMap<>();
  example.put("key", "value");
  System.out.println(example.toString());
  ```
  Output: `{key=value}` (not valid JSON).

  In contrast:
  ```java
  String json = new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(example);
  System.out.println(json);
  ```
  Output: `{"key":"value"}` (valid JSON).

Your original code (`iterate.getValue().toString()`) inadvertently passed invalid input to `readValue`, which caused the parser to fail.

---

### Key Takeaway:
Your fix ensured that:
1. Any object, whether JSON-like or not, is serialized into a proper JSON string before parsing.
2. Eliminating `.toString()` avoided malformed representations, making the `readValue` process robust.
