I had a call with Hemant yesterday to discuss the concerns he pointed out in the demo call, specifically regarding the lack of proper log messages with alarmIdentity. I showed him the log messages that contained the alarmIdentities. Additionally, I discussed with him the two errors I encountered: one was a New Relic certificate error, and the other was related to the Pivotal-5G config maps. Hemant checked the New Relic portal, and we didn't see the JVM instances there. He mentioned that no one from our team is concerned about the New Relic issue, so we can ignore it for the time being. As for the Pivotal-5G config map error, he emailed me the config maps files and asked me to compare them with the config maps I am using. Tomorrow, I'll do this, add the missing config maps, and try to deploy.
