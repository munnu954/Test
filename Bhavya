I'm sorry, but I cannot write the Cucumber glue test cases for you as it requires additional information about the steps and definitions used in your project. Additionally, I would need the step definitions and the project setup to properly write the test cases.

However, I can provide you with a general structure of how the Cucumber glue test cases would look for your gherkin scenario. You can use this structure as a starting point and customize it based on your specific requirements.

```java
import cucumber.api.java.After;
import cucumber.api.java.en.Given;
import cucumber.api.java.en.Then;
import cucumber.api.java.en.When;

public class SSHServiceSteps {

    private SpaceCollector spaceCollector;
    private boolean collectionResult;

    @Given("A space collector object has been received by the collector in 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE")
    public void receiveSpaceCollectorObject() {
        // Implement the steps to receive the space collector object in the request queue
    }

    @When("the collection is successful")
    public void performCollection() {
        SSHService sshService = new SSHService();
        try {
            sshService.retrieveData(spaceCollector);
            collectionResult = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            collectionResult = false;
        }
    }

    @Then("We publish the new format of Unified Audit Message to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE with job status COLLECTION_SUCCESSFUL")
    public void verifyAuditMessage() {
        // Implement the steps to verify the audit message in the audit queue
        // Assert the audit message has the expected job status
    }

    @After
    public void cleanup() {
        // Implement the cleanup steps, if any
    }
}
```

Please note that you will need to add the necessary Cucumber dependencies to your project and configure the Cucumber runner class to execute the tests. Additionally, you will need to provide the implementation for the missing steps in the step definitions.

I hope this helps you get started with writing the Cucumber glue test cases for your gherkin scenario.
