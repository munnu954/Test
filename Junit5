Subject: Re: Updated Parser Code and Demo Document

Hi Dmitry,

Thank you for your insights. I wanted to let you know that I have updated the parser code to handle the unhandled attributes as discussed. Additionally, I have also updated the demo document accordingly.

Could you please take a moment to review these changes and approve the Jira at your earliest convenience? 

Thanks for your assistance!

Best,  
Ahmed
