I apologize for not having read the complete message that you forwarded by clicking on 'show more.' They expect to create a matching rule for forwarding MantaRay Trap alarms to the HPOV-TRAP feed. They also expect to populate region, equipment type, equipment class, and manager class, along with the source system ID. My mistake; I did not read the complete forwarded message. Could we request a Jira for this work?
