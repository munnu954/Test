**Gherkin Test Cases:**

**Scenario 1:** Custom data transformation job fails to submit and pushes failure message to the audit queue.

Given a xml/csv file with 10 records
When the transform job is invoked and it throws error
And status code received is Not OK
And push failure message to the audit queue
Then validate the failure message has no_of_records_processed is zero
And validate the failure message has exceptions with job submission failed
And it has a stack track of the failure

**Scenario 2:** Publishing to the audit queue fails and the failure message is logged to a shared location.

Given a xml/csv file with 10 records
When the transform job is invoked and it throws error
And status code received is Not OK
And push failure message to the audit queue fails
Then write the same to a log file in shared location

**Scenario 3:** Input file is present but the input topic is not accessible. The failure is logged to a shared location and also pushed to the audit queue.

Given a xml/csv file with 10 records
When the topic 3459-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE is not accessible
Then write the same to a log file in shared location
And write the same to 3459-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE

**Scenario 4:** Jar file is not uploaded to the flink cluster and failure is logged to the shared location.

Given that no jars are present as jobs on the flink cluster
And the FLINK JOBS table has no entries
Then push failure message to the audit queue fails
And write the same to a log file in shared location

**Scenario 5:** Non-existent jar id is passed to the flink cluster and failure is logged to the shared location.

Given a non-existent jar id of the job
When the transform job is triggered with the non-existent jar id
Then the invocation fails
And status code received is Not OK
Then push failure message to audit queue fails
And write the same to a log file in shared location

**Test Cases:**

**Scenario 1:**
Test Case 1:
- Input: xml/csv file with 10 records
- Mock: transform job throws error and status code received is Not OK
- Expected Output: 
  - Failure message with no_of_records_processed: 0,
  - Failure message with exceptions: "job submission failed" with a stack trace of the failure

**Scenario 2:**
Test Case 2:
- Input: xml/csv file with 10 records
- Mock: transform job throws error and status code received is Not OK
- Mock: push failure message to the audit queue fails
- Expected Output: 
  - Log file in shared location containing the failure message

**Scenario 3:**
Test Case 3:
- Input: xml/csv file with 10 records
- Mock: topic 3459-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE is not accessible
- Expected Output: 
  - Log file in shared location containing the message "topic 3459-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE is not accessible"
  - Failure message pushed to 3459-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE

**Scenario 4:**
Test Case 4:
- Mock: no jars are present as jobs on the flink cluster
- Mock: the FLINK JOBS table has no entries
- Expected Output: 
  - Failure message push to audit queue fails
  - Log file in shared location containing the failure message

**Scenario 5:**
Test Case 5:
- Input: non-existent jar id of the job
- Mock: transform job is triggered with the non-existent jar id and invocation fails with status code Not OK
- Expected Output: 
  - Failure message push to audit queue fails
  - Log file in shared location containing the failure message
