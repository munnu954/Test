Positive test scenarios:
1. Verify that when a space collector object is received by the collector in the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE and the collection is successful, the new format of Unified Audit Message is published to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE with the job status COLLECTION_SUCCESSFUL.
2. Verify that the collector handles and processes multiple space collector objects received in the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE correctly, and publishes the corresponding Unified Audit Messages with the correct job status to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE.

Negative test scenarios:
1. Verify that if the space collector object received in the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-REQUEST-QUEUE is corrupted or invalid, the collector handles the error gracefully and does not publish any Unified Audit Message to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE.
2. Verify that if the collection process encounters an unexpected error or exception, the collector handles the error properly and publishes a Unified Audit Message to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE with the job status COLLECTION_FAILED.
