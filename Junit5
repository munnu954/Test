The regex pattern ("%[a-zA-Z_\\[\\]0-9\\s]+:[a-zA-Z_\\[\\]0-9\\s]+\\.[a-zA-Z_\\[\\]0-9\\s]+%") appears to be mostly correct. However, there is an issue with the last part of the pattern that attempts to match a dot followed by alphanumeric characters within square brackets and whitespace.

If you want to allow a dot followed by alphanumeric characters within square brackets and whitespace, you can modify the last part of the pattern as follows:

Corrected regex pattern: ("%[a-zA-Z_\\[\\]0-9\\s]+:[a-zA-Z_\\[\\]0-9\\s]+\.[a-zA-Z_\\[\\]0-9\s]+%")

This pattern will match strings that start with '%' followed by a sequence of characters in the range a-z, A-Z, underscore, square brackets, digits, and whitespace, then a colon, followed by another sequence of similar characters, and ending with a dot, alphanumeric characters within square brackets and whitespace, and finally '%'.
