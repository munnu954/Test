The error `ORA-01756: quoted string not properly terminated` usually indicates that there is an issue with the way quotes are used in your SQL query. In your query, it looks like the issue might be related to the use of empty quotes in the `LISTAGG` function. 

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the quotes are properly formatted. Here’s a revised version of your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT clli_a, clli_z, complement_name AS cable_name, LISTAGG(fiber_num, '') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fiber_num) AS fiber_num FROM gisfim.fiber_layout_record WHERE (fiber_circuit_id = :circuitId OR NFID = :nfid) AND status IS NOT NULL AND status <> 'CANCELLED' GROUP BY clli_a, clli_z, complement_name
```

If the issue persists, please double-check the context where this query is being used. If it's being used in a Java application, ensure that any single quotes are properly escaped if necessary. Here’s how it might look in Java:

```java
String query = "SELECT DISTINCT clli_a, clli_z, complement_name AS cable_name, LISTAGG(fiber_num, '') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fiber_num) AS fiber_num FROM gisfim.fiber_layout_record WHERE (fiber_circuit_id = :circuitId OR NFID = :nfid) AND status IS NOT NULL AND status <> 'CANCELLED' GROUP BY clli_a, clli_z, complement_name";
```

Make sure that any potential string concatenation or variable substitution does not interfere with the query’s syntax, especially with regard to quotes.
