Certainly! Below is the updated query to check if `locationCLLI` and `siteName` parameters are present in the `queryParams` map, and only append the corresponding conditions if they are present.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
  site.clli_code AS locationCLLI, 
  site.site_name AS locationCode, 
  site.site_name AS siteName, 
  site.address AS "unparsedAddress", 
  site.city as city, 
  site.state AS state, 
  site.country as country, 
  site.zip_code as zip, 
  site.site_code, 
  'COCONUT' AS "createdBySys" 
FROM 
  gdnm_switch switch 
LEFT JOIN 
  gdnm_hardware hardware ON switch.hardware_id = hardware.id 
LEFT JOIN 
  gdnm_site site ON switch.site_id = site.id 
WHERE 
  1=1
  -- Check if locationCLLI parameter is present
  AND (:locationCLLI IS NULL OR site.clli_code = lower(:locationCLLI) OR site.clli_code = upper(:locationCLLI))
  -- Check if siteName parameter is present
  AND (:siteName IS NULL OR site.site_name = :siteName)
```

This query uses the `1=1` trick to simplify the conditional appending of `WHERE` clauses. The `:locationCLLI IS NULL` and `:siteName IS NULL` checks ensure that the conditions for `locationCLLI` and `siteName` are only appended if the parameters are present.
