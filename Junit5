Certainly! To fetch only the `tid`, `clli`, and `site_name` from the given query, you can modify the `SELECT` clause accordingly. Here's how the query would look:

```sql
SELECT 
    switch.switch_name AS tid, 
    site.clli_code AS clli, 
    site.site_name
FROM 
    gdnm_switch switch
LEFT JOIN 
    gdnm_hardware hardware ON switch.hardware_id = hardware.id
LEFT JOIN 
    gdnm_site site ON switch.site_id = site.id
WHERE 
    switch.switch_name = LOWER(:tid) 
    OR switch.switch_name = UPPER(:tid);
```

This query will return only the columns `tid`, `clli`, and `site_name` based on the conditions specified.
