To achieve 100% code coverage for the `getClrGraphics` method in the `CommonWrapperController` class, you need to cover the missed branch of the conditional statement. The missed branch is likely related to the case where `cnd` is both blank and not equal to "Y". Here's how you can write an additional JUnit 5 test case to cover this branch:

```java
@Test
public void testGetClrGraphicsWithBlankCndButNotY() throws Exception {
    String circuitId = "testCircuitId";
    String sourceSys = "testSourceSys";
    String cnd = " "; // Blank with spaces
    String phyModel = "testPhyModel";
    String expectedResponse = "expectedResponse";

    // Mock the service call to return a specific response
    when(service.getClrGraphics(anyString(), anyString(), eq("N"), anyString())).thenReturn(expectedResponse);

    // Call the method under test
    String response = controller.getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, cnd, phyModel);

    // Verify that the response is not null and matches the expected response
    Assertions.assertNotNull(response);
    Assertions.assertEquals(expectedResponse, response);

    // Verify that the service method was called with the expected transformed cnd value "N"
    verify(service).getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, "N", phyModel);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Setup Test Inputs:**
   - The `cnd` is set to a blank string with spaces. This simulates the condition where `cnd` is blank but not strictly `null` or empty, thus testing the logic where `cnd` is assigned "N".

2. **Mocking Service Call:**
   - We mock the `getClrGraphics` service method to check if it's called with the transformed `cnd` value of "N".

3. **Assertions:**
   - We assert that the response from the controller is not null and matches the expected value.
   - We also verify that the service method was called with the correct arguments, especially checking that `cnd` was transformed to "N".

By adding this test case, you should be able to achieve 100% branch coverage for the `getClrGraphics` method in the `CommonWrapperController` class.
