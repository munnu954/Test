To address the `ORA-01756: quoted string not properly terminated` error, we should carefully check the usage of quotes within the SQL query. Let's slightly adjust the query to ensure that the quotes are used correctly.

Here's a revised version:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT clli_a, clli_z, complement_name AS cable_name, LISTAGG(fiber_num, '') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fiber_num) AS fiber_num FROM gisfim.fiber_layout_record WHERE (fiber_circuit_id = :circuitId OR NFID = :nfid) AND status IS NOT NULL AND status <> 'CANCELLED' GROUP BY clli_a, clli_z, complement_name
```

If this still doesn't resolve the issue, consider that there might be another context-related problem:

1. **Double Quotes**: Ensure that your SQL environment or the client you're using supports double quotes for column aliases or other identifiers if needed.

2. **Escaping Quotes**: If you're using this query within a programming language like Java, make sure that quotes are properly escaped. For example, in Java, you would use double backslashes to escape quotes:

   ```java
   String query = "SELECT DISTINCT clli_a, clli_z, complement_name AS cable_name, LISTAGG(fiber_num, '') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fiber_num) AS fiber_num FROM gisfim.fiber_layout_record WHERE (fiber_circuit_id = :circuitId OR NFID = :nfid) AND status IS NOT NULL AND status <> 'CANCELLED' GROUP BY clli_a, clli_z, complement_name";
   ```

3. **Environment Settings**: Check if there are any database settings or configurations related to string handling that might be affecting the execution.

If the problem persists, please provide more context about where and how this query is executed (e.g., within a specific programming environment, database client, etc.). This will help in diagnosing the issue more accurately.
