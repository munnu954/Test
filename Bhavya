It appears that there are a few issues in your code that need to be addressed. First, it seems that an unexpected NullPointerException is being thrown, and the code is not handling it as expected. This can result in an unexpected exception type being thrown, leading to an AssertionFailedError in your test case.

To fix this issue, you need to add proper exception handling and remove the possible cause of the NullPointerException. Here's a revised and more robust version of your FileUtility class:

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.core.io.Resource;
import org.springframework.core.io.UrlResource;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

@Component
public class FileUtility {

    @Value("${files.directory}")
    private String dir;

    public Resource getFileAsResource(String fileCode) throws IOException {
        Path foundFile = findFile(fileCode);
        if (foundFile == null) {
            throw new FileNotFoundException("File Not found");
        }
        
        return new UrlResource(foundFile.toUri());
    }

    private Path findFile(String fileCode) throws IOException {
        Path dirPath = Paths.get(dir);
        Path foundFile = null;

        try {
            foundFile = Files.list(dirPath)
                    .filter(file -> file.getFileName().toString().startsWith(fileCode))
                    .findFirst()
                    .orElse(null);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle the exception
            // Log the error or rethrow the exception as per your application's error handling strategy
            throw e;
        }

        return foundFile;
    }

    public String getHeaderValue(String filename) {
        return "attachment; filename=\"" + filename + "\"";
    }
}


In this revised code:
- The getFileAsResource method now first calls the findFile method to look for the file. If the file is not found, it throws FileNotFoundException. The findFile method now properly handles the file lookup and exception handling.
- Exception handling has been added to deal with potential IO issues.
- The unnecessary member variable contentType and foundFile have been removed to ensure clarity and to avoid any possible misuse or unexpected behavior.
- The code now uses functional programming constructs for better clarity and performance.

By incorporating these changes, the code should handle exceptions more robustly and eliminate the possibility of NullPointerException being thrown unexpectedly. If you have further questions or specific requirements, feel free to ask for more assistance!
