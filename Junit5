In the Acceptance Criteria, it is mentioned as demo-listed services, and in the description, it mentions updaters, reducers, providers, and resync-workers. Is it only the AlarmReducer service under reducers, AlarmRuleUpdatePublisher and AlarmUpdatePublisher services under updaters, ResyncWorker service under resync-workers, and these four services are included in the Providers gitlab link under providers? These mentioned services need to be migrated from Pulsar to Kafka, right, as part of this Jira? If I missed anything, please correct me if I am wrong.
