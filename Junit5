The error you're encountering, "IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 1 out of bounds for length 1," suggests that the code is trying to access an element at index 1 in a list that only has one element. In the context of the `testProcess_TargetNotFoundAndIndexGreaterThanZero` test case, this likely means that `clrComponentList` needs to be properly initialized with at least two elements before calling the `process` method.

Let's correct this by ensuring `clrComponentList` is populated with the necessary components before the test is run:

```java
@Test
public void testProcess_TargetNotFoundAndIndexGreaterThanZero() {
    // Ensure clrComponentList has at least two elements
    ClrComponent firstComponent = new ClrComponent();
    firstComponent.setType("CIRCUIT");
    clrComponentList.add(firstComponent);

    ClrComponent secondComponent = new ClrComponent();
    secondComponent.setType("TRAIL");
    clrComponentList.add(secondComponent);

    // Mock the CircuitDetailsProvider response if necessary
    CircuitDetailResponse response = new CircuitDetailResponse();
    // Set up the response with required mock data
    when(cktDetProvider.getCircuitDetails(anyString())).thenReturn(response);

    // Call the process method with i > 0
    trailProcessor.process(nodes, links, clrComponentList.get(1), clrComponentList, clliNodeMap, 1, ukCount, "sourceSys");

    // Assertions for expected behavior
    assertEquals(2, links.size()); // Assuming a new link is added when target is not found
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Populating `clrComponentList`**: Ensure that `clrComponentList` contains at least two elements before we attempt to access index 1. In this case, we're adding two `ClrComponent` instances to the list.

2. **Mocking**: If `CircuitDetailsProvider` is involved in this specific test scenario, ensure that the mock is set up to return a valid `CircuitDetailResponse` when its method is called.

3. **Assertions**: Adjust the assertions based on the expected state of your `links` list after processing. In this scenario, we're assuming that a new link should be added, which is why we're checking for a size of 2.

By ensuring the list is properly populated and all necessary mock dependencies are set up, you can avoid the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` and achieve the desired test coverage.
