To write JUnit test cases for the `ETAS` file type transformation within the `XmlToJsonConverter` class, you will need to use a combination of Flink testing utilities and mock objects. The focus of these test cases will be to assert that the `successIntCounter` has a count of 40 and the `failureIntCounter` has a count of 0 after the transformation of a given `ETAS.xml` file with 40 records.

When writing test cases for Flink jobs, you can use the Flink `CollectSink` utility class to collect the results of the transformation, and Mockito (or similar frameworks) to test interactions and internals of your classes.

Here's how you might go about writing these JUnit test cases:

```java
import org.apache.flink.streaming.util.CollectSink;
import org.apache.flink.api.common.typeinfo.BasicTypeInfo;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.AbstractStreamOperator;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.StreamFlatMap;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.streamrecord.StreamRecord;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.util.CollectSink;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.util.OneInputStreamOperatorTestHarness;
import org.apache.flink.test.util.AbstractTestBase;
import org.apache.flink.util.Collector;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

// Assuming XmlTransformerApplication.java and XmlToJsonConverter.java are in the same package
public class XmlToJsonConverterTest extends AbstractTestBase {

    @Test
    public void testEtasTransformation() throws Exception {
        // Create a test harness for the operator
        StreamFlatMap<String, String> operator = new StreamFlatMap<>(new XmlToJsonConverter("ETAS"));
        OneInputStreamOperatorTestHarness<String, String> testHarness =
            new OneInputStreamOperatorTestHarness<>(operator);

        testHarness.open();

        // Read ETAS.xml file from resources
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("src/test/resources/files/ETAS.xml"));
        StringBuilder xmlContent = new StringBuilder();
        String line;
        while((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            xmlContent.append(line);
        }
        reader.close();

        // Process the XML content
        testHarness.processElement(new StreamRecord<>(xmlContent.toString()));

        // Use CollectSink to get the output from the operator
        CollectSink<String> sink = new CollectSink<>();
        operator.setOutput(new CollectSinkOutput<>(sink));

        // Trigger all operators, functions, timers, and checkpoints to execute.
        testHarness.close();

        // Assertions
        final int successCount = operator.getSuccessCount();
        final int failureCount = operator.getFailureCount();

        Assert.assertEquals("There should be 40 successful transformations", 40, successCount);
        Assert.assertEquals("There should be no failures", 0, failureCount);
    }
}
```

In this test:

1. We start by creating a test harness for the `StreamFlatMap` operator, which uses `XmlToJsonConverter`.
2. We read the contents of the `ETAS.xml` from the resources directory.
3. We then use `processElement` to feed the contents into our `StreamFlatMap` operator within the test harness.
4. Using `CollectSink`, we collect the transformed JSON outputs.
5. We retrieve the counts from `successIntCounter` and `failureIntCounter` and perform assertions.

Note that this is a sample test skeleton. It may be necessary to adjust the file-reading mechanism depending on the actual content and structure of `ETAS.xml`, as well as to ensure that the actual path to `ETAS.xml` is correct and accessible during the test execution. Also, ensure that necessary library dependencies for mocking and Flink's test utilities are added to your project.

Keep in mind that your `XmlToJsonConverter` class and its methods will need to be properly designed for testability for this test to work. For example, the `flatMap` function might need proper exception handling and accumulator registration. It's also advised to follow good practices for Flink job testing by preserving and managing Flink's lifecycle and runtime context in your unit tests.
