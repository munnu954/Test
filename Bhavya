The `MissingMethodInvocationException` indicates that there is an issue with how you've set up your mocks using Mockito. This typically occurs when you attempt to stub a method call that is not on a mock object or involves methods that cannot be stubbed (like final or private methods).

In your case, it seems like there might be an issue with the way you are calling `when()` on certain objects or methods that are not part of the mocks. Letâ€™s carefully refactor the test to ensure that all the method calls are being made on mocks, and we will also check the structure of the payload and mock setups.

### Refactored Test Method

Here's a revised version of the test method, ensuring all method calls are correctly stubbed:

```java
@Test
void testOnMessage_SuccessfulProcessing() throws JsonProcessingException {
    // Arrange
    String validPayload = "{\"RequestJSONString\": \"{...}\"}"; // Mock a valid payload
    ConsumerRecord<String, String> consumerRecord = new ConsumerRecord<>("topic", 0, 0, "key", validPayload);

    ServiceMessage serviceMessage = new ServiceMessage();
    serviceMessage.setRequestJSONString("{\"Service\": {\"ServiceBody\": {\"CallRequest\": {\"Body\": {\"Relinquishing Customer Details\": {\"AccountNumber\": \"12345\"}}}}}}}");

    RequestJSONString requestJSONString = new RequestJSONString();
    Service service = new Service();
    ServiceBody serviceBody = new ServiceBody();
    CallRequest callRequest = new CallRequest();
    Body body = new Body();
    CustomerDetails customerDetails = new CustomerDetails();
    customerDetails.setAccountNumber("12345");
    body.setRelinquishingCustomerDetails(customerDetails);
    callRequest.setBody(body);
    serviceBody.setCallRequest(callRequest);
    service.setServiceBody(serviceBody);
    requestJSONString.setService(service);

    // Mock the necessary methods
    when(utils.convert(validPayload, ServiceMessage.class)).thenReturn(serviceMessage);
    // Ensure the requestJSONString can be converted from the serviceMessage
    when(serviceMessage.getRequestJSONString()).thenReturn("{\"Service\": {}}");
    when(utils.convert("{\"Service\": {}}", RequestJSONString.class)).thenReturn(requestJSONString);
    when(accountService.getEcpdByAcctId(anyString())).thenReturn(Mono.just("ecpdId"));

    // Act
    eventsMessageListener.onMessage(consumerRecord, validPayload);

    // Assert
    // Verify that the method does not throw any exceptions
    assertDoesNotThrow(() -> eventsMessageListener.onMessage(consumerRecord, validPayload));

    // Verify that the Kafka template's send method was called
    verify(kafkaTemplate, times(1)).send(any());
}
```

### Key Adjustments

1. **ConsumerRecord Initialization**: Make sure the `ConsumerRecord` is properly initialized with the mock payload that will be passed to your listener.

2. **Correct Stubbing**:
   - Ensure that the `when()` calls are made on mock objects only. The line `when(serviceMessage.getRequestJSONString()).thenReturn(...)` should be valid if `serviceMessage` is a regular object and not a mock. If `serviceMessage` is a regular object, you don't need to stub it. Instead, you should set the expected value directly.
   - The `when(utils.convert(...))` calls should reference the correct string literals or expected output.

3. **Payload Structure**: Ensure that the payload structure you define matches the expected structure in the `onMessage` method. The mock payload needs to align with how the `ServiceMessage` and `RequestJSONString` classes are set up to parse the payload.

### Troubleshooting

- If you are still encountering issues:
  - Double-check that the methods you are stubbing are indeed part of your mock objects (`utils`, `accountService`, etc.).
  - Verify that none of the methods you are trying to stub are final or private, as Mockito cannot mock those.
  - Ensure that your `MockitoExtension` is correctly set up in your test class to handle the mocks.

This refactored test method should resolve the `MissingMethodInvocationException` and ensure that the test runs as expected. If you encounter further issues, please provide the error message, and we can continue troubleshooting from there.
