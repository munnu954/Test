I suspect there is an issue with this WLS Actionable Matching rule. I updated a few alarms from the Apollo UAT DB that satisfy the rule matching criteria for this WLS Actionable Matching rule, yet I still don't see these updated alarms in the elastic logs. There are no Actionable Alarm flows in DEV, UAT, and PLE environments. I see the message publishing logs in PROD. I'll confirm with Kumar whether this Actionable Matching rule is up to date with the recent changes or not. Generally, I don't see any producer topic-related logs on Elastic from the past 90 days.
