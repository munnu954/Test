The error message you are seeing indicates that the `purgeRepublishedRecord` method on the `failedMessageService` mock was expected to be called during the execution of your test, but it was never invoked. This suggests that the code path leading to this method being called was not executed.

### Possible Reasons and Solutions

1. **Check Sensitivity Logic**: Ensure that the logic in the `kafkaFalloutProcessor` (where the `purgeRepublishedRecord` is invoked) is executed. If the entity's sensitivity check or other conditions prevent this logic from running, the method won't be called.

2. **Verify Payload**: Make sure the payload and other properties of the `KafkaFailedMessagesEntity` you are using in your test are set up correctly to meet the conditions required for `purgeRepublishedRecord` to be called.

3. **Debug the Processor Logic**: Add logging or print statements in the `kafkaFalloutProcessor` to verify that it is being executed as expected and to check the values being processed.

4. **Use ArgumentCaptor**: Use Mockito's `ArgumentCaptor` to capture the arguments passed to `purgeRepublishedRecord` if you want to inspect what is being passed in the method call.

### Updated Example

Here's an updated version of your test case that includes checks for the conditions that would lead to `purgeRepublishedRecord` being called:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.batch.item.ItemWriter;
import org.springframework.batch.item.Chunk;
import org.springframework.kafka.support.SendResult;

import java.util.Date;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class KafkaFalloutBatchConfigTest {

    @Mock
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @Mock
    private KafkaFalloutService failedMessageService;

    @InjectMocks
    private KafkaFalloutBatchConfig kafkaFalloutBatchConfig;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this); // Initialize mocks
    }

    @Test
    public void testKafkaFalloutWriterPositive() throws Exception {
        // Prepare the writer
        ItemWriter<KafkaFailedMessagesEntity> writer = kafkaFalloutBatchConfig.kafkaFalloutWriter();
        
        // Create a new KafkaFailedMessagesEntity instance
        KafkaFailedMessagesEntity entity = new KafkaFailedMessagesEntity();

        // Create and set the ID for the entity
        KafkaFailedMessagesPK id = new KafkaFailedMessagesPK();
        id.setTransactionId("trans123"); // Set a valid transaction ID
        id.setTopicName("testTopic"); // Set a valid topic name
        id.setCreatedDate(new Date()); // Set the current date as created date
        entity.setId(id); // Set the ID in the entity

        // Set the payload and sensitivity to trigger the purge
        entity.setPayload("Sample Payload");
        entity.setSensitivityChecked('Y'); // Set this to 'Y' to trigger purge logic

        // Create a Chunk directly
        Chunk<KafkaFailedMessagesEntity> chunk = new Chunk<>();
        chunk.add(entity); // Add the entity to the chunk

        // Create a mock SendResult
        SendResult<String, String> sendResultMock = mock(SendResult.class);
        
        // Create a CompletableFuture that returns the mocked SendResult
        CompletableFuture<SendResult<String, String>> future = CompletableFuture.completedFuture(sendResultMock);

        // Mock the kafkaTemplate.send() method to return the CompletableFuture
        when(kafkaTemplate.send(eq("testTopic"), anyString())).thenReturn(future);

        // Write the chunk
        writer.write(chunk);

        // Validate interactions (e.g. purgeRepublishedRecord called)
        verify(failedMessageService, times(1)).purgeRepublishedRecord(any());
    }
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Set Sensitivity**: In this example, the `sensitivityChecked` property is set to `'Y'` to ensure that the logic in the processor that calls `purgeRepublishedRecord` is executed. Adjust this according to the actual logic in your processor.

2. **Debugging**: If the method is still not being called, consider adding logging in your processor to see if the conditions that lead to the call are being met.

### Conclusion

By ensuring that the conditions under which `purgeRepublishedRecord` is called are met, you should be able to resolve the issue where the method is not being invoked. If further issues persist, consider debugging the logic in the `kafkaFalloutProcessor` to see exactly what is happening during the test execution.
