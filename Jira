Janosh informed me that I'll be part of Correlations-2 team from today. Could you please share with me the list of software to be installed, Gitlab repository details, as well as any other access I need to be granted for this particular project. FYI, I already have access to the SPACE jira project, as I was a member of the SPACE COLLECTIONS team prior to joining here.




Please share with me the KT recordings for this correlation-2 project, if available, so that I can go through them once and try to understand them

She was unable to access the project drive earlier, but now she has access, thank you!

Please give me and Bhavya access to the gitlab repositories, and please let me know what software needs to be installed on our locals as well as what access we will need for this project.

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.






If possible, would you be able to assign the above user stories to Bhavya and I for the next Q1.3 iteration?
