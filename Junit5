I have some personal work during the demo time (some wedding invitation distribution work). I'll email and inform Dmitry to review and accept my demo documents offline. Apologies for the inconvenience caused. I'll log in after 9 PM and check if Dmitry requires any further input from my side in order to accept my Jiras.
