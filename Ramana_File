Positive Junit5 Testcases Scenarios:

1. Given a valid text file with content, when the TextToJson Transformer is invoked, then it should successfully generate the corresponding JSON output.
2. Given a large text file with complex content, when the TextToJson Transformer is invoked, then it should efficiently and accurately generate the JSON output without any errors.
3. Given a text file with special characters and unicode content, when the TextToJson Transformer is invoked, then it should properly handle and convert the content to valid JSON format.

Negative Junit5 Testcases Scenarios:

1. Given an empty text file, when the TextToJson Transformer is invoked, then it should throw an exception or return an error indicating that the input is invalid.
2. Given a non-existent text file path, when the TextToJson Transformer is invoked, then it should throw an exception or return an error indicating that the file could not be found.
3. Given a text file with invalid format or encoding, when the TextToJson Transformer is invoked, then it should throw an exception or return an error indicating that the input format is not supported.
