Hello, I am using WebEx platform to resolve our queries that occur on a daily basis on a team level, just as we used to, and we will be connecting multiple times a day, which is why my PMR will be running continuously for hours. I have read the Verizon Webex Landing page and Scheduled Meetings, so I will use my PMR very precisely from now on.




I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.






If possible, would you be able to assign the above user stories to Bhavya and I for the next Q1.3 iteration?
