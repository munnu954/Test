To write a JUnit 5 test case covering the catch block of the `evaluateExpression` method, you can create a test case where an exception is expected to be thrown during the execution of the `parse` method.

Here's an example test case that you can use as a starting point:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

public class AlarmPostingUtilsTest {

    @Test
    public void testEvaluateExpressionThrowsException() {
        // Arrange
        AlarmPostingUtils utils = new AlarmPostingUtils();
        Environment env = mock(Environment.class);
        utils.setEnv(env);
        String expression = "invalid expression";
        Map<String, Object> topoMap = new HashMap<>();
        when(env.getProperty("some.property")).thenReturn("some value");
        doThrow(new Exception("Expected exception")).when(utils).parse(expression, topoMap, "");

        // Act and Assert
        assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> utils.evaluateExpression(expression, topoMap));
    }
}
```
In this test case, we are using Mockito to mock the `Environment` object and its `getProperty` method. We are also using Mockito to stub the `parse` method of the `AlarmPostingUtils` class to throw an exception.

When the `evaluateExpression` method is called with the mocked objects and the invalid expression, the test will pass if an exception is thrown.

Note: You will need to add Mockito as a dependency in your test project to use the `mock` and `when` methods.
