Scan dates have been updated for the AlarmState and RMF-APIs services after the manual deployment of these two services on the One Pipeline portal. We are not sure why these two services were not picked up during the automatic weekly scan job. I observed one thing: one possible reason for this is that the regression security stage for these two services is failing. I reached out to Hemant a few days ago about this regression test case failure. He said that he is not aware of this regression issue. Do you know of any POC who can help us with this?
