Would it be possible to reschedule the Q1.1 call to 4pm, please, since I am working from Office on Tuesday, and my Office bus starts exactly at 5:30pm, would it be possible for the call to be rescheduled?


Certainly! Here's the updated UnifiedAuditMessage class with added validations:

```java
@Data
public class UnifiedAuditMessage {

    @NotEmpty(message = "inputFilePath cannot be empty")
    private String inputFilePath;

    @NotEmpty(message = "url cannot be empty")
    private String url;

    @Positive(message = "port must be a positive integer")
    private Integer port;

    @NotEmpty(message = "outputFilePath cannot be empty")
    private String outputFilePath;

    @NotEmpty(message = "delimiters cannot be empty")
    private String delimiters;

    @NotEmpty(message = "fileType cannot be empty")
    private String fileType;

    @NotNull(message = "date_received cannot be null")
    private DateTime date_received;

    @NotNull(message = "date_processed cannot be null")
    private DateTime date_processed;

    @Min(value = 0, message = "no_of_records_in_the_file must be a non-negative integer")
    private Integer no_of_records_in_the_file;

    @Min(value = 0, message = "no_of_records_processed must be a non-negative integer")
    private Integer no_of_records_processed;

    @Min(value = 0, message = "no_of_records_failed must be a non-negative integer")
    private Integer no_of_records_failed;

    @NotNull(message = "job_id cannot be null")
    private UUID job_id;

    @NotNull(message = "jar_id cannot be null")
    private UUID jar_id;

    @NotEmpty(message = "exceptions list cannot be empty")
    private List<String> exceptions;

    @NotNull(message = "collector_id cannot be null")
    private UUID collector_id;

    @NotNull(message = "job_status cannot be null")
    private JobStatus job_status;
}
```

In the updated class:
- I have used annotations from the javax validation API to add the validations.
- I have added appropriate error messages for each validation.
- I have included annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@NotEmpty`, `@Min`, `@Positive` to enforce the validations on the respective fields.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies (e.g., `javax.validation:validation-api`, `org.hibernate.validator:hibernate-validator`) added to your project to utilize these validations.
