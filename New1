To create a workable and executable JUnit test case for the main class `SshServerApplication`, you can use the following code:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class SshServerApplicationTest {

    @Test
    public void testMainMethod() {
        // You can use a simple test to check if the main method runs without throwing any exceptions
        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> SshServerApplication.main(new String[]{}));
        
        // Add additional assertions or checks based on the behavior of your main application
    }
}
```

Make sure the `SshServerApplicationTest` class is in the same package as the `SshServerApplication` class for easier testing. This test case will test that the `main` method of the `SshServerApplication` class can run without throwing any exceptions. Remember to configure your IDE or build tool to run JUnit tests.
