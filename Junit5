Hi Dmitry, GM 
Just wanted to confirm the scope of the jira - <link of jira>

The MantaRay alarms must go via VSM and WLS provider. Now since we are keeping the sourceSystemId value as 'RAN_Nokia_LTE', so I see it's already part of VSM Matching Rule <link to VSM matching rule>, and for WLS, I need to add the sourceSystemId in this rule - <link to WLS matching rule>.

Is my understanding correct?
