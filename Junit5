when(messageProducer.publishTheMessageToVMB(anyString())).thenThrow(new JsonProcessingException("Mocked JsonProcessingException") {});





It looks like the issue is that the `assertThrows` method is expecting a `RuntimeException` to be thrown, but the `JsonProcessingException` thrown by your mock is not a subclass of `RuntimeException`. In Java, `JsonProcessingException` is a subclass of `IOException`, which is a checked exception, and not a `RuntimeException`, which is an unchecked exception.

To fix the test, you should change the expected exception in the `assertThrows` method to `JsonProcessingException` or a superclass of it that is not `RuntimeException`. Here's how you can modify your test:

```java
@Test
void testPublishMessage_JsonProcessingExceptionHandled() {
    // Mock the behavior of MessageProducer to throw JsonProcessingException
    when(messageProducer.publishTheMessageToVMB(anyString())).thenAnswer(invocation -> {
        throw new JsonProcessingException("Mocked JsonProcessingException") {};
    });

    // Create sample data for the test
    HashMap<String, Object> alarmMap = new HashMap<>();
    alarmMap.put("alarmIdentity", "TestAlarm123");

    // Call the method to test and expect JsonProcessingException
    assertThrows(JsonProcessingException.class, () -> {
        cbrsSuppressionService.publishMessage(alarmMap, "TestAlarm123");
    });
}
```

Make sure to import the correct `JsonProcessingException` class at the beginning of your test file:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;
```

This should resolve the `AssertionFailedError` and make your test pass by correctly expecting the `JsonProcessingException`. Remember to handle or declare this exception in your `publishMessage` method as it's a checked exception. If your `publishMessage` method is not designed to throw `JsonProcessingException`, you'll need to wrap it in a `RuntimeException` within the method implementation.
