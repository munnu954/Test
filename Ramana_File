Sure! Here are some JUnit 5 test cases to cover the given acceptance criteria:

Positive Test Cases:

1. All records have successfully been processed (10 records xml):
   - Test case: transformXmlToJson_AllRecordsProcessed
   - Given: a xml file with 10 records
   - When: transforming the records to json
   - And: all the records are successfully processed
   - And: pushing the success message to the audit queue
   - Then: validate that the success message has no_of_records_processed equal to ten
   - And: validate that the success message has no_of_records_failed equal to zero

2. Partial success (10 records with 6 passed, 4 failed):
   - Test case: transformXmlToJson_PartialSuccess
   - Given: a xml file with 10 records
   - When: transforming the records to json
   - And: some of the records have failed
   - And: some of the records have successfully processed
   - And: pushing the partial success message to the audit queue
   - Then: validate that the partial success message has no_of_records_processed equal to six
   - And: validate that the partial success message has no_of_records_failed equal to four

Negative Test Cases:

3. All records have failed (10 records xml):
   - Test case: transformXmlToJson_AllRecordsFailed
   - Given: a xml file with 10 records
   - When: transforming the records to json
   - And: all the records have failed
   - And: pushing the failure message to the audit queue
   - Then: validate that the failure message has no_of_records_processed equal to zero
   - And: validate that the failure message has no_of_records_failed equal to ten

4. The XMLToJSONTransformer throws exceptions and job processing fails:
   - Test case: transformXmlToJson_TransformationFailedException
   - Given: a xml file with 10 records
   - When: the transform method throws an exception
   - And: pushing the failure message to the audit queue
   - Then: validate that the failure message has no_of_records_processed equal to zero
   - And: validate that the failure message has exceptions with "transformation failed"

5. Input file is not present and output topic '3459-COLLECTION-DATA-QUEUE' is present given a XML file with 10 records:
   - Test case: transformXmlToJson_InputFileNotPresent
   - Given: a xml file with 10 records
   - When: the transform method throws an exception
   - And: pushing the failure message to the audit queue
   - Then: validate that the failure message has no_of_records_processed equal to zero
   - And: validate that the failure message has exceptions with "input file not present"

6. Input file is present and output topic '3459-COLLECTION-DATA-QUEUE' is not accessible:
   - Test case: transformXmlToJson_OutputTopicNotAccessible
   - Given: a xml file with 10 records
   - When: the transform method throws an exception
   - And: pushing the failure message to the audit queue
   - Then: validate that the failure message has no_of_records_processed equal to zero
   - And: validate that the failure message has exceptions with "output topic not accessible"

These test cases can be implemented using JUnit 5 framework and Mockito to mock dependencies and simulate different scenarios.
