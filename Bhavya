It seems that the logger you're using has a different method signature than what was assumed. The errors indicate that your logger's `debug` and `warn` methods are expecting a `Throwable` and a `Supplier<String>`, rather than a format string and parameters. This is often the case with frameworks that support lazy logging.

### Modifying the Test Case

Given this, you can modify the test case to match the expected method signature. Here’s how you can adjust the test to accommodate that:

1. **Use `any()` for the first argument** (which is usually a `Throwable`), and a `Supplier<String>` for the log message.
2. **Use `mock` or `spy`** to capture the log output if necessary, but we will focus on verifying that the logging methods are called correctly.

### Updated Test Case

Here’s how the test case can be structured:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations;

import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

class KafkaFalloutBatchConfigCTITest {

    @InjectMocks
    private KafkaFalloutBatchConfigCTI kafkaFalloutBatchConfigCTI;

    @Mock
    private EcpdService ecpdService; // Replace with actual service type

    @Mock
    private Logger LOGGER; // Mock the logger

    private KafkaFailedMessagesEntity item;
    private String mtn = "1234567890"; // Example MTN
    private long callEstablishedId = 1L; // Example Call Established ID

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);
        item = new KafkaFailedMessagesEntity();
        // Set up item properties if needed
    }

    @Test
    void testFalloutWhenRedisEcpdIdIsNull() {
        // Simulate the scenario where redisEcpdid is null
        when(ecpdService.getEcpdId(mtn)).thenReturn(null); // Mock the behavior to return null

        // Call the method under test
        KafkaFailedMessagesEntity result = kafkaFalloutBatchConfigCTI.kafkaFalloutProcessorCTI().process(item);

        // Verify that the logging occurs
        verify(LOGGER, times(1)).debug(any(Throwable.class), any()); // Adjusted to match method signature
        verify(LOGGER, times(1)).warn(any(Throwable.class), any()); // Adjusted to match method signature

        // Verify that falloutExpiryCheckAndDelete is called
        verify(kafkaFalloutBatchConfigCTI, times(1)).falloutExpiryCheckAndDelete(item, any(), any());

        // Assert the result is null
        assertNull(result, "The result should be null when redisEcpdid is null");
    }
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Logger Verification**:
   - The `debug` and `warn` methods are now called with `any(Throwable.class)` and `any()` instead of specific string values. This aligns with the expected method signatures of your logger.

2. **Remove Argument Captors**:
   - Since we're not capturing specific log messages in this case, we can verify the logger calls directly without using `ArgumentCaptor`.

### Additional Considerations:
- If you want to capture and assert on the actual log messages, you would need to set up a custom logging appender or use a library like LogCaptor to capture log output in your tests.
- Make sure that your logging framework is correctly configured and that the logger in your application is compatible with how you're mocking it in the tests.

By making these adjustments, you should be able to run the test without encountering type mismatch errors. If you have further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
