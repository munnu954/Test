Abbas and I had a continuous 3Â½-hour-long call with Kumar and Hemant yesterday. There are some runtime errors for the AlarmNormalizer service in OCP DEV. I checked with Kumar yesterday, but we were unable to resolve those errors. Today I'll try to fix the runtime error of the AlarmNormalizer service. The express deployment of the AlarmNormalizer feature branch was surprisingly successful, although we had runtime errors.
