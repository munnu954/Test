Sure! Here are some positive and negative JUnit5 test case scenarios for the given description and acceptance criteria:

Positive Test Cases:

1. AC1: Successful Transformation Job Submission
   - Scenario: Given a Unified Audit Message is received by the custom-data-transformer-client
     - Given: A Unified Audit Message is available in 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE
   - When: The transformation job submission is successful
     - When: The custom-data-transformer-client submits the transformation job
   - Then: The new format of Unified Audit Message is published to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE with job_status FLINK_JOB_SUBMITTED
     - Then: The custom-data-transformer-client publishes the transformed message with the updated job status

2. AC2: Unsuccessful Transformation Job Submission
   - Scenario: Given a Unified Audit Message is received by the custom-data-transformer-client
     - Given: A Unified Audit Message is available in 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE
   - When: The transformation job submission is not successful
     - When: The custom-data-transformer-client fails to submit the transformation job
   - Then: The new format of Unified Audit Message is not published to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE with job_status FLINK_JOB_FAILED
     - Then: The custom-data-transformer-client does not publish the transformed message and the job status remains unchanged

Negative Test Cases:

1. AC1: Unified Audit Message not received
   - Scenario: Given no Unified Audit Message is received by the custom-data-transformer-client
     - Given: There are no messages available in 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE
   - When: The transformation job submission is successful
     - When: The custom-data-transformer-client tries to submit the transformation job
   - Then: There is no new format of Unified Audit Message published to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE
     - Then: The custom-data-transformer-client does not publish any transformed message

2. AC2: Transformation job submission fails unexpectedly
   - Scenario: Given a Unified Audit Message is received by the custom-data-transformer-client
     - Given: A Unified Audit Message is available in 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE
   - When: The transformation job submission unexpectedly fails
     - When: The custom-data-transformer-client encounters an error while submitting the transformation job
   - Then: The new format of Unified Audit Message is not published to the 3459-DEV-COLLECTION-AUDIT-QUEUE with job_status FLINK_JOB_FAILED
     - Then: The custom-data-transformer-client does not publish the transformed message and the job status remains unchanged

These are just a few examples of possible JUnit5 test cases for the given description and acceptance criteria. You can further expand on these cases or create additional cases based on your specific requirements and implementation details.
