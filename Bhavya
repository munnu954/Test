The error "com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: UnknownHostKey" indicates that the host key for the SSH server is not recognized or trusted. To fix this issue, you can use the following approach to add the SSH server's host key to the JSch known hosts file.

First, you need to create a known hosts file and add the host key to it. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
ssh-keyscan -t rsa localhost >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

This command retrieves the RSA host key for the "localhost" SSH server and appends it to the known hosts file.

After adding the host key to the known hosts file, you can update your SSHService class to set the known hosts file path for the JSch session:

```java
// Set the path to the known hosts file
String knownHostsFile = System.getProperty("user.home") + "/.ssh/known_hosts";
jsch.setKnownHosts(knownHostsFile);
```

Add this code after creating the JSch instance in the retrieveData method:

```java
JSch jsch = new JSch();
String knownHostsFile = System.getProperty("user.home") + "/.ssh/known_hosts";
jsch.setKnownHosts(knownHostsFile);
Session session = jsch.getSession(sshUsername, sshHost);
```

This will set the known hosts file for the JSch session, and it should resolve the "UnknownHostKey" error.
