Subject: Change of Sponsor Request

Dear Lokesh,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have been transferred to a new assignment with the UTS Topology team and am no longer part of the SPACE Collections program. As a result, I would like to request a change of sponsor from you to the new manager, Srinivas Rao Bandi.

I believe that having Srinivas as my sponsor will better align with my new role and responsibilities within the UTS Topology team. I kindly ask for your assistance in facilitating this change as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this transition period. I look forward to your prompt action on this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
