It would be very difficult for me to log in from the hostel with a mobile hotspot. My availability will be limited to office hours on the days when I work from the office.

Hi Kumar, can you please clarify one thing for me? Firstly, which certificate are we going to use for Kafka testing? Is it the old K2 PEM cert file that was provided by the Offshore SPACE team, or the new cert files provided by the VMB? Also, can you confirm whether the ApolloKafkaLibrary code supports it or not?


Can you please confirm whether the current codebase of the ApolloKafkaLibrary service supports these VMB cert files? On Friday, you asked me to modify the ApolloKafkaLibrary service's code so that it injects properties from the application properties. Can you please provide detailed steps here so that it can be a reference for me, enabling me to research with ChatGPT? I'm confused about what steps need to be followed next for this VMB Pulsar to Kafka migration.

Apologies, but I'll be traveling from the office during DSU time, so network connectivity will be poor and a lot of background disturbances will occur.

Can you please approve this Adom request I raised 3 days ago. I'm unable to build or run microservices locally, so please grant me access to vi1v_art artifactory.

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.
