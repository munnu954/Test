Certainly! Here's the query formatted as a single line:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT site.clli_code AS locationCLLI, site.site_name AS locationCode, site.site_name AS siteName, site.address AS "unparsedAddress", site.city as city, site.state AS state, site.country as country, site.zip_code as zip, site.site_code, 'COCONUT' AS "createdBySys" FROM gdnm_switch switch LEFT JOIN gdnm_hardware hardware ON switch.hardware_id = hardware.id LEFT JOIN gdnm_site site ON switch.site_id = site.id WHERE 1=1 AND (:locationCLLI IS NULL OR site.clli_code = lower(:locationCLLI) OR site.clli_code = upper(:locationCLLI)) AND (:siteName IS NULL OR site.site_name = :siteName)
```
