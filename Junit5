To ensure all branches of the conditional statement are covered, let's break down the condition more clearly:

```java
if (StringUtils.isBlank(cnd) || ((StringUtils.isBlank(cnd)) && (!cnd.equalsIgnoreCase("Y")))) {
    cnd = "N";
} else {
    cnd = "Y";
}
```

This condition simplifies to:

1. If `cnd` is blank (null, empty, or whitespace), set `cnd` to "N".
2. If `cnd` is not blank and is "Y", keep `cnd` as "Y".
3. If `cnd` is not blank and not "Y", set `cnd` to "N".

We need to ensure that all possible logical combinations are tested:

1. `cnd` is null.
2. `cnd` is an empty string.
3. `cnd` is a whitespace string.
4. `cnd` is "Y".
5. `cnd` is any non-blank and non-"Y" string.

Here is the additional test case to cover the missed branch:

```java
@Test
public void testGetClrGraphicsWithNonBlankCndAndNotY() throws Exception {
    String circuitId = "testCircuitId";
    String sourceSys = "testSourceSys";
    String cnd = "N"; // Non-blank and not "Y"
    String phyModel = "testPhyModel";
    String expectedResponse = "expectedResponse";

    // Mock the service call to return a specific response
    when(service.getClrGraphics(anyString(), anyString(), eq("N"), anyString())).thenReturn(expectedResponse);

    // Call the method under test
    String response = controller.getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, cnd, phyModel);

    // Verify that the response is not null and matches the expected response
    Assertions.assertNotNull(response);
    Assertions.assertEquals(expectedResponse, response);

    // Verify that the service method was called with the expected transformed cnd value "N"
    verify(service).getClrGraphics(circuitId, sourceSys, "N", phyModel);
}
```

### Explanation

- **Setup Test Inputs:** Here, `cnd` is set to "N", which is non-blank and not equal to "Y". This should result in `cnd` being set to "N".
- **Mocking Service Call:** We check if `getClrGraphics` is called with `cnd` set to "N".
- **Assertions:** Assert the response is as expected and validate that the service call was made correctly with the transformed `cnd`.

This additional test case ensures that the branch where `cnd` is neither blank nor "Y" is covered, thus achieving 100% branch coverage for the condition in question.
