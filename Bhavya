Based on the error message that you provided, it seems that the setKeyPairProvider method expects an argument of type <any org.apache.sshd.server.keyprovider.SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider>. To resolve the error, you can directly instantiate a SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider object and pass it to the setKeyPairProvider method. Here is how you can reframe the code:

```java
// Create an instance of SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider
SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider keyProvider = new SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider();
sshServer.setKeyPairProvider(keyProvider);
```

In the above code snippet, we directly create a SimpleGeneratorHostKeyProvider object and pass it as an argument to the setKeyPairProvider method of the SshServer object.

By reframing the code in this way, you should be able to resolve the error related to the setKeyPairProvider method argument. Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.
