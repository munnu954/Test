Have you spoken with Pavan about our continuation in this Collections Team after this ongoing 1.6 iteration?

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.






If possible, would you be able to assign the above user stories to Bhavya and I for the next Q1.3 iteration?
