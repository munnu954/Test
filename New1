The root cause of the error seems to be a mismatch in deserialization when trying to convert a `String` representation of a JSON into a `HashMap`. Specifically:
- The incoming message has `AggregationDetails` stored as a `String` (`"{\"timeWindow\":300,\"count\":1,\"timeWindowUnits\":\"seconds\"}"`).
- The cached message has `AggregationDetails` already deserialized into a `HashMap`.
- Your code attempts to deserialize `AggregationDetails` using `RulesConstants.getObjectMapper().readValue(iterate.getValue().toString(), HashMap.class)`, but since `AggregationDetails` is already a `HashMap` in `cachedMsg`, this results in an attempt to deserialize a `String` when itâ€™s not required.
