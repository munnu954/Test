To achieve 100% code coverage of the `createConsumerConnection(String, String)` method in the `KafkaMessageConsumer` class as per your request, we need to ensure that all possible branches are covered by writing suitable JUnit5 test cases. 

Here is an outline of the test cases required to cover all 18 missed branches for this method:

1. Test case to cover the branch when `consumerProps` is null.
2. Test case to cover the branch when `consumer` is not null.
3. Test cases to cover the branches inside the `isValidConsumer` predicate:
   a. Consumer is null
   b. Subscribed topic is null
   c. Consumer does not contain subscribed topic
4. Test cases to cover the retry loop:
   a. Successful consumer creation within the retry count
   b. Unsuccessful consumer creation exceeding the retry count
5. Test cases to cover exceptions:
   a. KafkaException during consumer creation
   b. InterruptedException during the process

Below is the example code showing how these test cases could be written:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;

@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class KafkaMessageConsumerTest {

    @Mock
    private KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer;

    @Test
    public void testCreateConsumerConnection_NullProps() {
        // Test case to cover the branch when consumerProps is null
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateConsumerConnection_NotNullConsumer() {
        // Test case to cover the branch when consumer is not null
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateConsumerConnection_IsValidConsumer() {
        // Test cases to cover the branches inside the isValidConsumer predicate
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateConsumerConnection_SuccessfulCreation() {
        // Test case for successful consumer creation within the retry count
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateConsumerConnection_ExceedRetryCount() {
        // Test case for unsuccessful consumer creation exceeding the retry count
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateConsumerConnection_KafkaException() {
        // Test case for KafkaException during consumer creation
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateConsumerConnection_InterruptedException() {
        // Test case for InterruptedException during the process
    }
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of these test cases will depend on the specific logic and behavior of your application. Feel free to modify and expand upon these examples as needed to ensure thorough testing of the `createConsumerConnection(String, String)` method.
