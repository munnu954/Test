Based on the error message you received, it seems like you are using argument matchers incorrectly in your test case. Argument matchers should only be used in stubbing (`when`) and verification (`verify`) contexts.

Here is a reframed and updated JUnit 5 test case code for `PostRuleProcessingService` class without any argument matchers:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class TestPostingRuleProcessingService {

    @Test
    public void testApplyPostingRule() {
        // Create a mock of the PostRuleProcessingService
        PostRuleProcessingService postRuleProcessingService = mock(PostRuleProcessingService.class);
        
        // Define the input parameters 
        PostingRule postingRule = new PostingRule();
        List<Transaction> transactions = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Call the method under test
        postRuleProcessingService.applyPostingRule(postingRule, transactions);
        
        // Verify that the method was called with the correct parameters
        verify(postRuleProcessingService).applyPostingRule(postingRule, transactions);
    }
}
```
Make sure to replace `PostRuleProcessingService` with the actual class name that contains the `applyPostingRule` method. Also, ensure that the method `applyPostingRule` in `PostRuleProcessingService` class is not a final, private, or equals/hashCode method as those cannot be stubbed or verified using Mockito.

By using the `verify` method in the test case, you can check that the `applyPostingRule` method was called with the expected parameters during the test execution.
