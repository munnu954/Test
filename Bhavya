The `UnnecessaryStubbingException` indicates that there are some stubbings in your test method that are not being used during the execution of the test. This often happens when the mock setup is more extensive than what is actually invoked during the test run.

In your case, it looks like the stubbing for `utils.convert(validPayload, ServiceMessage.class)` might not be necessary if the method is not called in the subsequent test code.

Here's how you can refactor the test method to avoid unnecessary stubbings:

### Refactored Test Method

```java
@Test
void testOnMessage_SuccessfulProcessing() throws JsonProcessingException {
    // Arrange
    ServiceMessage serviceMessage = new ServiceMessage();
    serviceMessage.setRequestJSONString("{...}"); // Mock the necessary fields if needed

    when(utils.convert(validPayload, ServiceMessage.class)).thenReturn(serviceMessage);
    when(accountService.getEcpdByAcctId(anyString())).thenReturn(Mono.just("ecpdId"));

    // Act
    eventsMessageListener.onMessage(consumerRecord, validPayload);

    // Assert
    // Verify that the method does not throw any exceptions
    assertDoesNotThrow(() -> eventsMessageListener.onMessage(consumerRecord, validPayload));

    // Verify that the Kafka template's send method was called
    verify(kafkaTemplate, times(1)).send(any());
}
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed Unused Stubbing**: The unnecessary stubbing of `utils.convert(validPayload, ServiceMessage.class)` now ensures that it is actually used in the test. I've included a mock setup for `serviceMessage`.

2. **Assert Does Not Throw**: I've kept the `assertDoesNotThrow` statement in the correct place to ensure that the method does not throw any exceptions during execution.

3. **Verify Call to Kafka Template**: After the method execution, I added a verification step to ensure that the `send` method on the `kafkaTemplate` is called, which checks that the processing logic is functioning as expected.

### Additional Tips

- Ensure that the `validPayload` string is properly constructed to match the expected input format.
- If you need to adjust the test further based on how the methods are processed within the listener, you can continue refining the mocks and assertions.

This should help you resolve the `UnnecessaryStubbingException` and maintain a clean test setup.
