AlarmPosting: Jira's code changes and testing are done, and we are waiting for the MR review. For the BAU monitoring story, there are no new errors recorded. I'm working on the AlarmDeduplication service's Exception ERROR.




ERROR - com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot construct instance of 'java.util.HashMap' (although at least one Creator exists): no String-argument constructor/factory method to deserialize from String value ('{"timeWindow":300,"count":1,"timeWindowUnits":"seconds"}')
at [Source: REDACTED ('StreamReadFeature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION' disabled); line: 1, column: 1] while processing this resultMsg input:- {description=Node Down, Region=East/West, MessageType=STATUS, category=STATUS, gateway=VSA, AggregationDetails={"timeWindow":300,"count":1,"timeWindowUnits":"seconds"}}



Apologies, but I'll be traveling from the office during DSU time, so network connectivity will be poor and a lot of background disturbances will occur.

Can you please approve this Adom request I raised 3 days ago. I'm unable to build or run microservices locally, so please grant me access to vi1v_art artifactory.

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.
