Verizon Outage Management & Operational Strategy
This consolidated report outlines the application designed to enhance Verizon’s network reliability by correlating real-time alarms, mapping customer data, and automating outage notifications.
1. Core Strategy: Proactive vs. Reactive
 * Proactive Management: The system monitors real-time alarms to identify potential systemic issues before they escalate, significantly reducing unnecessary technician dispatches and operational costs.
 * Reactive Management: Triggered by identified network failures, generating automated tickets for resolution.
 * Outage Threshold: A formal outage is typically generated when the system detects a customer impact level exceeding 66% on a specific network element.
2. Technical Architecture & Data Flow
The application relies on a multi-layered data pipeline to move information from the network to the management interface:
 * Ingestion: Real-time alarms are ingested via streaming APIs from Delphi into K2View.
 * Messaging: Kafka serves as the central message bus, utilizing a "publish-subscribe" model to allow decoupled communication between different system components.
 * Processing: Enrichment functions process these alarms at the OLT (Optical Line Terminal) level to group impacted customers sharing the same network identifiers.
 * Storage: * Cassandra: Acts as a staging database to track customer IDs and alarm thresholds.
   * MicroDBs: Store specific customer-level data. Note: There is currently no automatic backup for MicroDBs; inactive customers are removed via manual scripts.
   * Master Database: Updates every 15 minutes to ensure data accuracy.
3. Data Management & Automation
 * Geolocation: Python scripts automatically fetch and update customer latitude and longitude coordinates using the Google API, syncing this data into Cassandra every 15 minutes.
 * Focus Shift: The monitoring scope has narrowed; the system now focuses exclusively on set-top boxes and no longer processes data from routers.
 * Pattern Recognition: The application identifies specific error patterns within data files received from hardware to improve diagnostic accuracy.
4. Operational Improvements & Future Goals
 * Efficiency: By correlating alarms, the system creates "Group Tickets" for outages affecting multiple customers on the same element, preventing redundant work.
 * Documentation: A key takeaway was the need to update existing documentation to reflect recent changes in the processing logic.
 * Development: Future initiatives include creating a dedicated API to track outages and customer notifications specifically related to OLTs and ensuring all customers are mapped to relevant data tables during network changes.
