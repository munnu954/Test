I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.



Positive Scenario:
1. Input: Valid MRFC CSV file with data
2. Action: CsvtoJsonMRFCnTransformer is invoked on the csv file
3. Expected Output: MRFC data from CSV file is successfully converted to JSON format
4. Validation: Validate the converted JSON content against the expected JSON structure

Negative Scenario:
1. Input: Invalid or empty MRFC CSV file
2. Action: CsvtoJsonMRFCnTransformer is invoked on the invalid CSV file
3. Expected Output: Transformation fails or produces an error due to invalid input
4. Validation: Verify that the transformation process does not complete successfully and an appropriate error message is generated
