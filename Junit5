We were able to establish a connection using the VMB team's cert files. We hardcoded the Kafka producer properties yesterday and established the connection. However, we were unable to publish to the Kafka topic provided by the VMB team. I posted the connection failure error in the help Kafka VMB channel. At least we were able to make progress.
