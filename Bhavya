Test Scenarios for the above test cases could include:

1. Test that the processRTROSCFile method successfully converts the CSV file to JSON format and writes it to the output topic.
   - Check that the converted JSON rows match the expected values.
   - Verify that the JSON rows are written to the output topic correctly.

2. Test that the validateConvertedRTR_OCSJsonRows method correctly validates the converted JSON rows.
   - Check that each JSON row is validated against the expected values.
   - Verify that an exception is thrown if a JSON row does not match the expected values.

3. Test that the nullCsvRow method throws a NullPointerException when a null value is passed as input.
   - Check that a NullPointerException is thrown when calling the flatMap method with null input.

4. Test that the invalidJsonRowValidation method throws an AssertionError when an invalid JSON row is passed as input.
   - Check that an AssertionError is thrown when calling the validateJsonRow method with an invalid JSON row.

These scenarios cover the main functionality and edge cases of the test cases provided.
