To write a JUnit 5 test case covering the catch block of the `shutdown` method in the `PostingService` class, you can use reflection to manipulate the private `threadList` field to ensure it contains threads that will throw an `InterruptedException` when joined. Here is a sample test case that achieves this:

```java
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;

import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * Test class for PostingService.
 */
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class PostingServiceTest {
    private static final Logger LOG = LogManager.getLogger(PostingService.class);

    private PostingService postingService;
    private ArrayList<Thread> mockThreadList;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        postingService = new PostingService();
        mockThreadList = new ArrayList<>();
        Field threadListField = PostingService.class.getDeclaredField("threadList");
        threadListField.setAccessible(true);
        threadListField.set(postingService, mockThreadList);
    }

    @Test
    public void testShutdownWithInterruptedException() throws Exception {
        Thread mockThread = createInterruptedThread();
        mockThreadList.add(mockThread);

        postingService.shutdown();

        // Verify that the log happens
        org.mockito.Mockito.verify(LOG).error(org.mockito.Mockito.contains("Interruped Exception occured"));
    }

    /**
     * This method creates a thread that throws InterruptedException when get joined.
     * @return the interrupted thread
     */
    private Thread createInterruptedThread() {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Swallow the exception for this test, as it will be propagated when joining the thread.
            }
        });
        thread.start();
        thread.interrupt();
        return thread;
    }
}
```

This test case:
1. Uses reflection to set the `threadList` field in the `PostingService` instance.
2. Adds a thread to `threadList` that is designed to be interrupted.
3. Calls the `shutdown` method on the `PostingService` instance, triggering the catch block when the interrupted thread's `join` method is invoked.
4. Uses logging verification to ensure that the log message was printed when the `InterruptedException` is caught.

Ensure that your `PostingService` class is adjusted to use constructor injection for the `Logger` instance to facilitate mocking in unit tests, or use a logging framework that supports mock verification.
Additionally, you need to include dependencies for Mockito and Log4j in your test classpath for mocking and verifying the log statements.
