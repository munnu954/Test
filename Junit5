I updated the logger message to capture the alarm that causes the error and closely monitored the AlarmPosting logs in all three non-production environments, i.e., DEV, UAT, and PLE. However, no such error mentioned in the Jira description has been recorded in the recent three weeks, and it has also not been recorded in GCP. This error cannot be replicated, and I also verified that the AlarmPosting service successfully processes alarms that don't contain a tag value.
