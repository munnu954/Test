Is it possible to execute those testcases in a dev environment without the inline dependency in the AlarmPosting Microservice's Pom.xml file, since that dependency is present in the APIParent pom.xml file?

I would like to request that the demo calls be scheduled for 5pm instead of 5:30pm, so that I can catch my office bus that evening.

update the above finalQuery such that the finalQuery should checks if the locationCLLI and siteName parameters are present in the queryParams map. If they are present, it appends the corresponding conditions to the finalQuery. If they are not present, it does not append anything to the finalQuery. The resulting finalQuery will work even without locationCLLI or siteName.
