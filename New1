Positive Junit5 Test Scenarios:

1. Test Case: Verify successful publishing of failure message to Audit Queue
   - Given a transform job that throws an error and returns a non-OK status code
   - When the job is invoked and the failure message is pushed to the Audit Queue
   - Then validate that the failure message is published successfully to the Audit Queue
   - And validate that the failure message contains the expected data, such as zero processed records and specific exceptions

2. Test Case: Verify logging of failure when publishing to Audit Queue fails
   - Given a transform job that throws an error and returns a non-OK status code
   - When the job is invoked and the failure message fails to be pushed to the Audit Queue
   - Then validate that the failure message is logged in a shared log file

3. Test Case: Verify logging when input topic is not accessible
   - Given a transform job with a valid input file and an inaccessible input topic
   - When the job is invoked and the input topic is not accessible
   - Then validate that the failure to access the input topic is logged in a shared log file
   - And validate that the failure message is pushed to the Audit Queue

4. Test Case: Verify logging and failure message when no jars are present on the Flink cluster
   - Given that there are no jars present as jobs on the Flink cluster
   - And the FLINK JOBS table has no entries
   - When the transform job is invoked
   - Then validate that the failure message is not pushed to the Audit Queue
   - And validate that the failure message is logged in a shared log file

5. Test Case: Verify logging and failure message when a non-existent jar id is passed to the Flink cluster
   - Given a non-existent jar id of the job
   - When the transform job is triggered with the non-existent jar id
   - Then validate that the invocation fails with a non-OK status code
   - And validate that the failure message is not pushed to the Audit Queue
   - And validate that the failure message is logged in a shared log file

Negative Junit5 Test Scenarios:

1. Test Case: Verify no publishing of failure message when the job completes successfully
   - Given a transform job that executes without any errors
   - When the job is invoked and completes successfully
   - Then validate that no failure message is pushed to the Audit Queue

2. Test Case: Verify no logging of failure when publishing to Audit Queue succeeds
   - Given a transform job that throws an error and returns a non-OK status code
   - When the job is invoked and the failure message is successfully pushed to the Audit Queue
   - Then validate that no failure message is logged in a shared log file

3. Test Case: Verify no logging when input topic is accessible
   - Given a transform job with a valid input file and an accessible input topic
   - When the job is invoked and the input topic is accessible
   - Then validate that no failure is logged in a shared log file

4. Test Case: Verify no logging and failure message when jars are present on the Flink cluster
   - Given that there are jars present as jobs on the Flink cluster
   - Or the FLINK JOBS table has entries
   - When the transform job is invoked
   - Then validate that no failure message is pushed to the Audit Queue
   - And validate that no failure message is logged in a shared log file

5. Test Case: Verify no logging and failure message when a valid jar id is passed to the Flink cluster
   - Given a valid jar id of the job
   - When the transform job is triggered with the valid jar id
   - Then validate that the invocation is successful with a OK status code
   - And validate that no failure message is pushed to the Audit Queue
   - And validate that no failure message is logged in a shared log file
