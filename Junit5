Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of the root cause of the issue and the fix that was applied:

### Root Cause of the Issue:
The original implementation of the `getArrayValueForTags` method was not equipped to handle different types of JSON node structures for the "tag" key. Specifically, it only attempted to process the node as a JSON string representation of an array using `objectMapper.readValue(jsonNode.get(key).asText(), String[].class);`. This approach worked for some inputs but failed in other scenarios:

1. **JSON Array**: If the "tag" value was a direct JSON array (e.g., `"tag": ["hidden"]`), the conversion to text using `.asText()` would not correctly represent the array, causing processing errors.
   
2. **Simple String**: If the "tag" value was a simple string (e.g., `"tag": "WLS"`), the method tried to parse it as an array, leading to errors because a simple string is not a valid JSON array.

These limitations resulted in exceptions when processing inputs that did not match the expected format.

### Fix Applied:
To address these issues, the method was updated to handle three distinct cases, ensuring it can process any type of input for the "tag" key:

1. **JSON Array Handling**:
   - If the JSON node is an actual array (`node.isArray()`), the method uses `objectMapper.treeToValue(node, String[].class);` to directly convert the node into a `String[]`. This handles cases where the "tag" value is naturally a JSON array.

2. **String Representation of JSON Array**:
   - If the JSON node is textual (`node.isTextual()`), the method checks if the text is a JSON string that represents an array (e.g., starts with `[` and ends with `]`). If so, it uses `objectMapper.readValue(textValue, String[].class);` to parse the text into a `String[]`.

3. **Simple String Handling**:
   - If the textual node does not represent an array, it is assumed to be a simple string. The method converts this string into a single-element array with `value = new String[]{textValue};`.

### Summary:
The root cause was the limited handling of different JSON node types, leading to exceptions when processing unexpected formats. The fix expanded the method to recognize and correctly process JSON arrays, string representations of arrays, and simple strings. This comprehensive approach ensures robust handling of varied input formats without causing exceptions.
